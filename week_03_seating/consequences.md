# Consequences

I originally learned about this from the book Weapons of Math
Destruction, but this article is about a DC area public school teacher
who was highly praised by administrators and parents alike, but fired
because of a policy that the bottom percentage of teachers in an
automated assessment process would be let go. (Part of the thesis of WMD
is that automated decision-making is usually subject to appeal for the
wealthy and privileged, but unyielding for the poor and marginalized.
Less than a week after being fired by the low-income school district
where she taught, Wysocki was hired to teach in a wealthy suburban
school district on the strength of the recommendation of her schoolâ€™s
principal.)
