  <div class="doctext">
  in grammar person is the way of referring to someone taking part in an
  event such as the person talking the person being talked to the person
  being talked about grammatican persons are accomplished by pronouns
  words used to take the place of noun in order to make speech easier
  the first person is the speaker referring to himself or herself the
  second person is the person whom someone is speaking to or writing to
  persons pronoun person plurality gender first person singular this
  comes from the person speaking we first person plural this comes from
  person part of group you second person singular or plural this comes
  from person talking directly to someone he third person masculine
  singular third person gender neutral singular masculine only for men
  or boys she third person feminine singular feminine only for women or
  girls it third person neutral singular this comes from person talking
  about something that has no gender they third person plural third
  person gender neutral singular the singular usage is commonly accepted
  effect on nouns very few nouns are second person nouns because people
  do not usually talk directly to things like tables in fact in english
  just about the only kind of nouns that are second person is small
  group of pronouns that can be seen in the table below english personal
  pronouns person singular plural subject object possessive subject
  object possessive first me mine we us ours second you you yours you
  you yours third female she her hers they them theirs male he him his
  no gender it it its sometimes person name is used in the second person
  but that usually just with baby for example instead of saying you sit
  here one could say charlie sits here effect on verbs in english
  grammar people do not usually have to do anything special to the verb
  if they use second person noun as subject in fact the verb be is the
  only verb that has special form for the second person are in other
  languages such as french though verbs change in different ways to
  match the subject in this table tu and vous are the second person
  pronouns we can see how the verb parler talk changes when people use
  them indicative subjunctive conditional imperative present simple past
  imperfect simple future present imperfect present present je parle
  parlai parlais parlerai parle parlasse parlerais tu parles parlas
  parlais parleras parles parlasses parlerais parle il parle parla

  pronoun is traditionally part of speech in grammar though many modern
  linguists call it type of noun in english pronouns are words such as
  me she his them herself each other it what pronouns are often used to
  take the place of noun when that noun is understood has already been
  named to avoid repeating it for example instead of saying tom has new
  dog tom has named the dog max and tom lets the dog sleep by tom bed it
  is easier to say tom has new dog he has named it max and he lets it
  sleep by his bed when pronoun replaces noun the noun is called the
  antecedent but there are times when the pronoun has no antecedent this
  is because generally the antecedent what comes before refers
  grammatically to the use of the relative pronoun in particular for
  example in the sentence the dog that was walking down the street the
  relative pronoun is the word that referring back to the antecedent the
  word dog in the sentence the spy who loved me the relative pronoun is
  the word who and its antecedent is the word spy differences and
  similarities to nouns pronouns are different from common nouns because
  they normally can not come after article or other determiner for
  example people do not say the it pronouns also rarely come after
  adjectives they are also different because many of them change
  depending on how they are used for example we is subject in grammar
  but the word changes to us when used as an object pronouns are the
  same as nouns because they both change for number singular plural case
  subject object possessive etc and gender male female animate inanimate
  etc nouns and pronouns can be used in almost all the same places in
  sentences and they name the same kinds of things people objects etc
  even though they can not normally come after determiners or adjectives
  neither can proper nouns kinds of pronouns there are four kinds of
  pronouns personal reciprocal interrogative and relative kinds of
  english pronouns personal you love them your sister loves herself ii
  reciprocal we like each other we are looking at one another iii
  interrogative who is there what happened iv relative the person who
  saw it the time which you told me personal pronouns in english this
  table shows all the personal pronouns in english that are commonly
  used today personal pronouns in english singular plural subject object
  possessive subject object possessive first me mine we us ours second
  you you yours you you yours third feminine she her hers they them
  theirs masculine he him his neuter it it its subject pronoun can
  replace noun that is the subject of sentence refer to the table above
  the subject pronouns are you he she it we they another type of
  personal pronoun is called the reflexive pronoun reflexive pronouns
  are the words ending in self or selves such as myself itself

  th century map of the sky astronomy is natural science it is the study
  of everything outside the atmosphere of earth it studies celestial
  objects such as stars galaxies planets moons asteroids comets and
  nebulae and processes such as supernovae explosions gamma ray bursts
  and cosmic microwave background radiation this includes the physics
  chemistry of those objects and processes the word astronomy comes from
  the greek words astron which means star and nomos which means law
  person who studies astronomy is called an astronomer astronomy is one
  of the oldest sciences ancient people used the positions of the stars
  to navigate and to find when was the best time to plant crops
  astronomy is very similar to astrophysics related subject physical
  cosmology is concerned with studying the universe as whole and the way
  the universe changed over time astronomy is not the same as astrology
  the belief that the patterns the stars and the planets may affect
  human lives since the th century there have been two main types of
  astronomy observational and theoretical astronomy observational
  astronomy uses telescopes and cameras to observe or look at stars
  galaxies and other astronomical objects theoretical astronomy uses
  maths and computer models to predict what should happen the two often
  work together the theoretical predicts what should happen and the
  observational shows whether the prediction works history of astronomy
  ancient early astronomers used only their eyes to look at the stars
  they used maps of the constellations and stars for religious reasons
  and also to work out the time of year early civilisations such as the
  maya people and the ancient egyptians built simple observatories and
  drew maps of the stars positions they also began to think about the
  place of earth in the universe for long time people thought earth was
  the center of the universe and that the planets the stars and the sun
  went around it this is known as geocentrism ancient greeks tried to
  explain the motions of the sun and stars by taking measurements
  mathematician named eratosthenes was the first who measured the size
  of the earth and proved that the earth is sphere theory by another
  mathematician named aristarchus was that the sun is in the center and
  the earth is moving around it this is known as heliocentrism only few
  people thought it was right the rest continued to believe in the
  geocentric model most of the names of constellations and stars come
  from greeks of that time arabic astronomers made many advancements
  during the middle ages including improved star maps and ways to
  estimate the size of the earth they also learned from the ancients by
  translating greek books into arabic renaissance to modern era drawings
  of the moon by galileo his drawings were more detailed than anyone
  before him because he used telescope to look at the moon during the
  renaissance priest named nicolaus copernicus thought from looking at
  the way the planets moved that the earth was not the center of
  everything based on previous works he said that the earth was planet
  and all the planets moved around the sun this brought back the old
  idea of heliocentrism physicist called galileo galilei built his own
  telescopes and used them to look more closely at the stars and planets
  for the first time he agreed with copernicus the catholic church
  decided that galileo was wrong he had to spend the rest of his life
  under house arrest heliocentric ideas were soon improved by johannes
  kepler and isaac newton who invented the theory of gravity after
  galileo people made better telescopes and used them to see farther
  objects such as the planets uranus and neptune they also saw how stars
  were similar to our sun but in range of colours and sizes they also
  saw thousands of other faraway objects such as galaxies and nebulae
  modern era the th century saw important changes in astronomy in karl
  jansky discovered radio emission from outside the earth when trying to
  isolate source of noise in radio communications marking the birth of
  radio astronomy and the first attempts at using another part of the
  electromagnetic spectrum to observe the sky those parts of the
  electromagnetic spectrum that the atmosphere did not block were now
  opened up to astronomy allowing more discoveries to be made the
  opening of this new window on the universe saw the discovery of
  entirely new things for example pulsars which sent regular pulses of
  radio waves out into space the waves were first thought to be alien in
  origin because the pulses were so regular that it implied an
  artificial source the period after world war saw more observatories
  where large and accurate telescopes are built and operated at good
  observing sites normally by governments for example bernard lovell
  began radio astronomy at jodrell bank using leftover military radar
  equipment by the site had the largest steerable radio telescope in the
  world similarly the end of the saw the start of the building of
  dedicated observatories at mauna kea in hawaii good site for visible
  and infra red telescopes thanks to its high altitude and clear skies
  the next great revolution in astronomy was thanks to the birth of
  rocketry this allowed telescopes to be placed in space on satellites
  space telescopes gave access for the first time in history to the
  entire electromagnetic spectrum including rays that had been blocked
  by the atmosphere the rays gamma rays ultraviolet light and parts of
  the infra red spectrum were all opened to astronomy as observing
  telescopes were launched as with other parts of the spectrum new
  discoveries were made from satellites were launched to be replaced
  with more accurate and better satellites causing the sky to be mapped
  in nearly all parts of the electromagnetic spectrum discoveries
  discoveries broadly come in two types bodies and phenomena bodies are
  things in the universe whether it is planet like our earth or galaxy
  like our milky way phenomena are events and happenings in the universe
  bodies for convenience this section has been divided by where these
  astronomical bodies may be found those found around stars are solar
  bodies those inside galaxies are galactic bodies and everything else
  larger are cosmic bodies solar planets asteroids comets galactic stars
  diffuse objects nebulas clusters compact stars white dwarves neutron
  stars black holes cosmic galaxies galaxy clusters superclusters
  phenomena burst events are those where there is sudden change in the
  heavens that disappears quickly these are called bursts because they
  are normally associated with large explosions producing burst of
  energy they include supernovas novas periodic events are those that
  happen regularly in repetitive way the name periodic comes from period
  which is the length of time required for wave to complete one cycle
  periodic phenomena include pulsars variable stars noise phenomena tend
  to relate to things that happened long time ago the signal from these
  events bounce around the universe until it seems to come from
  everywhere and varies little in intensity in this way it resembles
  noise the background signal that pervades every instrument used for
  astronomy the most common example of noise is static seen on analogue
  televisions the principal astronomical example is cosmic background
  radiation methods instruments telescopes are the main tool of
  observing they take all the light in big area and put in into small
  area this is like making your eyes very big and powerful astronomers
  use telescopes to look at things that are far away and dim telescopes
  make objects look bigger closer brighter spectrometers study the
  different wavelengths of light this shows what something is made of
  many telescopes are in satellites they are space observatories
  techniques there are way astronomers can get better pictures of the
  heavens light from distant source reaches sensor and gets measured
  normally by human eye or camera for very dim sources there may not be
  enough light particles coming from the source for it to be seen one
  technique that astronomers have for making it visible is using
  integration which is like longer exposures in photography integration
  astronomical sources do not move much only the rotation and movement
  of the earth causes them to move across the heavens as light particles
  reach the camera over time they hit the same place making it brighter
  and more visible than the background until it can be seen telescopes
  at most observatories and satellite instruments can normally track
  source as it moves across the heavens making the star appear still to
  the telescope and allowing longer exposures also images can be taken
  on different nights so exposures span hours days or even months in the
  digital era digitised pictures of the sky can be added together by
  computer which overlays the images after correcting for movement
  aperture synthesis with radio telescopes smaller telescopes can be
  combined together to create big one which works like one as big as the
  distance between the two smaller telescopes adaptive optics adaptive
  optics means changing the shape of the mirror or lens while looking at
  something to see it better data analysis data analysis is the process
  of getting more information out of an astronomical observation than by
  simply looking at it the observation is first stored as data this data
  will then have various techniques used to analyse it fourier analysis
  fourier analysis in mathematics can show if an observation over length
  of time is changing periodically changes like wave if so it can
  extract the frequencies and the type of wave pattern and find many
  things including new planets fields good example of fields comes from
  pulsars which pulse regularly in radio waves these turned out to be
  similar to some but not all of type of bright source in rays called
  low mass ray binary it turned out that all pulsars and some lmxbs are
  neutron stars and that the differences were due to the environment in
  which the neutron star was found those lmxbs that were not neutron
  stars turned out to be black holes this section attempts to provide an
  overview of the important fields of astronomy their period of
  importance and the terms used to describe them it should be noted that
  astronomy in the modern era has been divided mainly by electromagnetic
  spectrum although there is some evidence this is changing fields by
  body solar astronomy solar astronomy is the study of the sun the sun
  is the closest star to earth at around million miles away it is the
  easiest to observe in detail observing the sun can help us understand
  how other stars work and are formed changes in the sun can affect the
  weather and climate on earth stream of charged particles called the
  solar wind is constantly sent off from the sun the solar wind hitting
  the earth magnetic field causes the northern lights studying the sun
  helped people understand how nuclear fusion works planetary astronomy
  planetary astronomy is the study of planets moons dwarf planets comets
  and asteroids as well as other small objects that orbit stars the
  planets of our own solar system have been studied in depth by many
  visiting spacecraft such as cassini huygens saturn and the voyager and
  galactic astronomy galactic astronomy is the study of distant galaxies
  studying distant galaxies is the best way of learning about our own
  galaxy as the gases and stars in our own galaxy make it difficult to
  observe galactic astronomers attempt to understand the structure of
  galaxies and how they are formed through the use of different types of
  telescopes and computer simulations fields by electromagnetic spectrum
  radio astronomy radio telescope mhd hydrodynamics is used in astronomy
  for mathematically modelling how gases behave strong magnetic fields
  found around many bodies can drastically change how these gases behave
  affecting things from star formation to the flows of gases around
  compact stars this makes mhd an important and useful tool in astronomy
  other fields gravitational wave astronomy gravitational wave astronomy
  is the study of the universe in the gravitational wave spectrum so far
  all astronomy that has been done has used the electromagnetic spectrum
  gravitational waves are ripples in spacetime emitted by very dense
  objects changing shape which include white dwarves neutron stars and
  black holes because no one has been able to detect gravitational waves
  directly the impact of gravitational wave astronomy has been very
  limited related pages solar system planet satellite natural word for

  harry james potter is the main character in rowling harry potter
  fantasy series the books cover seven years in the life of the orphan
  who on his th birthday learns he is wizard and the son of magical
  parents lily and james potter he goes to hogwarts school of witchcraft
  and wizardry to learn magic harry soon learns that he is already
  famous in the world of wizards he also learns that his fate is
  connected to lord voldemort voldemort was an evil wizard who killed
  harry parents but was believed to have died when he tried to use the
  killing curse on the baby harry rowling said that the idea for the
  harry potter character came to her while waiting for train in she
  decided to make him an orphan following the death of her mother
  concept and creation according to author rowling the idea for both the
  harry potter books and the character came while waiting for delayed
  train from manchester to london in rowling said that in the hours she
  waited her idea for this scrawny black haired bespectacled boy who
  didn know he was wizard became more and more real to me rowling also
  decided to make harry an orphan at boarding school called hogwarts she
  explained harry had to be an orphan so that he free agent with no fear
  of letting down his parents disappointing them hogwarts has to be
  boarding school half the important stuff happens at night then there
  the security having child of my own reinforces my belief that children
  above all want security and that what hogwarts offers harry the death
  of her mother on december led rowling to write harry potter as boy
  longing for his dead parents his pain became more deeper more real
  than in earlier versions because she related to it herself in
  interview with the guardian rowling also said that the character of
  wart in white novel the sword in the stone is harry spiritual ancestor
  in that book boy called wart meets the mysterious sorcerer merlyn
  merlyn helps the child grow into noble powerful warrior who later
  becomes king arthur she also said that harry was born on july and has
  the same birthday as herself however she says harry is not directly
  based on any real life character he came just out of part of me
  appearances first book harry first appears in harry potter and the
  philosopher stone published in the united states as harry potter and
  the sorcerer stone as the book protagonist or main character when
  harry was little over one year old his parents were killed by the
  powerful dark wizard lord voldemort harry survived voldemort killing
  curse after his mother died to protect him the curse was turned back
  at voldemort and ripped his soul from his body because of this harry
  has lightning bolt shaped scar on his forehead rowling has said that
  creating the story about harry potter past was matter of reverse
  planning the basic idea is that harry didn know he was wizard and so
  then kind of worked backwards from that position to find out how that
  could be that he wouldn know what he was when he was one year old the
  most evil wizard in hundreds of years attempted to kill him he killed
  harry parents and then he tried to kill harry he tried to curse him
  harry has to find out before we find out and so but for some
  mysterious reason the curse didn work on harry so he left with this
  lightning bolt shaped scar on his forehead and the curse rebounded
  upon the evil wizard who has been in hiding ever since harry is
  written as an orphan living unhappily with his only family left the
  cruel dursleys on his eleventh birthday harry finds that he is wizard
  when rubeus hagrid tells him that he is to go hogwarts school of
  witchcraft and wizardry there he learns about his parents and his
  connection to the dark lord he is sorted into gryffindor house by the
  sorting hat and becomes friends with classmates ron weasley and
  hermione granger near the end of his first year at hogwarts he stops
  voldemort attempt to steal the philosopher stone he also forms
  rivalries with characters draco malfoy classmate from an elitist
  wizard family and the potions teacher and head of slytherin house
  severus snape both feuds continue throughout the series in interview
  rowling stated that draco is based on several schoolyard bullies she
  had known and snape on teacher of hers who abused his power rowling
  has said that the mirror of erised chapter in harry potter and the
  philosopher stone is her favourite the mirror reflects harry deepest
  desire namely to see his dead parents her favourite funny scene is
  when harry accidentally sets boa constrictor free from the zoo in the
  horrified dursleys presence second to fourth books in the second book
  harry potter and the chamber of secrets rowling pits harry against tom
  marvolo riddle memory of lord voldemort locked up in secret diary that
  ron younger sister ginny weasley finds in bathroom when muggle non
  magic parentage students are found being petrified many think that
  harry may be the one behind the attacks making him become more
  detached from his classmates at the height of the book ginny weasley
  is found to be missing to rescue her harry battles riddle and the
  monster he controls that is hidden in the chamber of secrets in the
  third book called harry potter and the prisoner of azkaban rowling
  uses time travel as the basis for the book harry learns that his
  parents were sold out to lord voldemort by their friend peter
  pettigrew also accused of framing harry godfather sirius black for
  crimes he didn make locking him up in the wizarding prison azkaban
  when black escapes to find revenge harry and hermione use time turner
  to save him and hippogriff named buckbeak pettigrew and the truth
  escape from sirius causing him to be on the run from the authorities
  in the previous books harry is written as child but rowling states
  that in the fourth novel harry potter and the goblet of fire harry
  horizons are literally and metaphorically widening as he grows older
  harry developing maturity becomes apparent when he becomes interested
  in cho chang pretty ravenclaw student tension mounts however when
  harry is mysteriously chosen by the goblet of fire to compete in the
  dangerous triwizard tournament even though another hogwarts champion
  cedric diggory was already selected it is actually an elaborate scheme
  by lord voldemort to lure harry into deadly trap during the tournament
  final challenge harry and cedric are teleported to graveyard cedric is
  killed and lord voldemort aided by peter pettigrew uses harry blood in
  gruesome ritual to resurrect voldemort body when harry duels voldemort
  their wands magical streams connect forcing the spirit echoes of
  voldemort victims including cedric and james and lily potter to be
  expelled from his wand the spirits shortly protect harry as he escapes
  to hogwarts with cedric body for rowling this scene is important
  because it shows how harry is brave and by finding cedric corpse he
  demonstrates selflessness and compassion says rowling he wants to save
  cedric parents additional pain she added that preventing cedric
  diggory body from falling into voldemort hands is based on the classic
  scene in the iliad where achilles finds the body of his best friend
  patroclus from the hands of hector the author said that iliad scene
  really really really moved me when read that when was the idea of the
  desecration of body very ancient idea was thinking of that when harry
  saved cedric body she also said that she cried while writing the scene
  when harry dead parents are drawn from voldemort wand the first time
  she cried while penning her story fifth and sixth book in the fifth
  book harry potter and the order of the phoenix the ministry of magic
  has been waging smear campaign against harry and dumbledore disputing
  their claims that voldemort has returned new character is introduced
  when the ministry of magic appoints dolores umbridge as the latest
  hogwarts defence against the dark arts instructor and ministry spy
  because the paranoid ministry thinks that dumbledore is building
  wizard army to overthrow them umbridge decides not to teach students
  real defensive magic she gradually gains more power eventually seizing
  control of the school as result harry growing angry and erratic
  behaviour nearly estranges him from ron and hermione rowling says she
  put harry through extreme emotional stress to show his emotional
  vulnerability and humanity contrast to his nemesis voldemort harry is
  very human hero and this is obviously contrast between him as very
  human hero and voldemort who has deliberately de humanised himself and
  harry therefore did have to reach point where he did almost break down
  and say he didn want to play anymore he didn want to be the hero
  anymore and he lost too much and he didn want to lose anything else so
  that phoenix was the point at which decided he would have his
  breakdown at hermione urging harry secretly teaches his classmates
  real defensive magic to thwart umbridge and the ministry but their
  meetings are found and dumbledore is ousted as headmaster harry
  suffers another emotional blow when his godfather sirius black is
  killed during battle with death eaters at the department of mysteries
  but harry ultimately defeats voldemort plan to steal an important
  prophecy and helps uncover umbridge sinister motives rowling stated
  and now he harry will rise from the ashes strengthened sideplot of
  order of the phoenix involves harry romance with cho chang but the
  relationship quickly unravels says rowling they were never going to be
  happy it was better that it ended early in the sixth book harry potter
  and the half blood prince harry enters tumultuous puberty that rowling
  says is based on her and her younger sister own difficult teenage
  years rowling also made an intimate statement about harry personal
  life because of the demands of the adventure that harry is following
  he has had less sexual experience than boys of his age might have had
  this inexperience with romance was factor in harry failed relationship
  with cho chang now his thoughts concern ginny weasley ron sister vital
  plot point in the last chapter when harry ends their budding romance
  to protect her from voldemort new character appears when former
  hogwarts potions master horace slughorn returns to replace severus
  snape who takes over the defence against the dark arts post harry
  excels in potions by using an old textbook once belonging to talented
  student known only as the half blood prince the book contains many
  handwritten notes revisions and new spells hermione however believes
  harry using it is cheating through private meetings with dumbledore
  harry learns about lord voldemort orphaned youth his rise to power and
  how he splintered his soul into horcruxes to achieve immortality two
  horcruxes have been destroyed and harry and dumbledore locate another
  although it is fake when death eaters invade hogwarts snape kills
  dumbledore as snape escapes he proclaims that he is the half blood
  prince harry admired mentor is actually his hated enemy it now falls
  upon harry to find and destroy voldemort remaining horcruxes and to
  avenge dumbledore death in interview with nbc anchorwoman katie couric
  rowling stated that after the events in the sixth book harry has taken
  the view that they are now at war he does become more battle hardened
  he now ready to go out fighting and he after revenge against voldemort
  and snape final book in harry potter and the deathly hallows harry ron
  and hermione leave hogwarts to complete dumbledore task to search for
  and destroy voldemort remaining four horcruxes and then find and kill
  the dark lord the three put themselves against voldemort newly formed
  totalitarian police state an action that tests harry courage and moral
  character according to rowling telling scene in which harry uses
  cruciatus and imperius unforgivable curses for torture and mind
  control on voldemort servants shows side to harry that is flawed and
  mortal however she explains that he is also in an extreme situation
  and attempting to defend somebody very good against violent and
  murderous opponent harry comes to recognise that his own single
  mindedness makes him predictable to his enemies and often clouds his
  perceptions when severus snape is killed by voldemort later in the
  story harry realises that snape was not the traitorous murderer he
  believed him to be but tragic anti hero who was loyal to albus
  dumbledore in chapter the prince tale snape memories show that he
  loved harry mother lily evans but their friendship ended over his
  association with future death eaters and blood purity beliefs when
  voldemort killed the potters grieving snape vowed to protect lily
  child although he loathed young harry for being james potter son it is
  also revealed that snape did not kill albus dumbledore but carried out
  dumbledore prearranged plan dumbledore who was dying from slow
  spreading curse wanted to protect snape position within the death
  eaters and spare draco malfoy from completing voldemort task to murder
  him to defeat harry voldemort steals the elder wand from dumbledore
  tomb it is the most powerful wand ever created and he twice casts the
  killing curse on harry with it the first attempt merely stuns harry
  into death like state in the chapter king cross dumbledore spirit
  tells harry that when voldemort failed to kill baby harry and
  disembodied himself harry became an unintentional horcrux voldemort
  could not kill harry while the dark lord soul shard was within harry
  body voldemort second killing curse also fails because voldemort used
  harry blood in his resurrection voldemort soul shard within harry was
  destroyed because harry willingly faced death in the next chapter the
  flaw in the plan it is established that harry not voldemort became the
  elder wand true master in the book climax the elder wand disobeys the
  dark lord command and rebounds the curse onto voldemort killing him
  rowling said the difference between harry and voldemort is that harry
  willingly accepts mortality making him stronger than his nemesis the
  real master of death accepts that he must die and that there are much
  worse things in the world of the living after voldemort defeat harry
  joins the auror office for revolutionised ministry of magic ten years
  afterwards harry is appointed department head by new minister of magic
  kingsley shacklebolt ron who helped george run the weasley wizarding
  wheezes joke shop for time is also an auror in the end rowling said
  his old rival draco malfoy has overcome his animosity after harry
  saved his life three times in the seventh book in the deathly hallows
  epilogue set nineteen years after voldemort death harry and ginny are
  married and have three children james sirius the oldest albus severus
  and lily luna movie appearances daniel radcliffe in the eight harry
  potter movies from harry potter has been played by british actor
  daniel radcliffe radcliffe was asked to audition for the role of harry
  potter in by producer david heyman while in at play titled stones in
  his pockets in london the harry potter role has earned much money for
  radcliffe as of he has an estimated wealth of million in interview
  with mtv radcliffe stated that for him harry potter is classic coming
  of age character that what the movies are about for me loss of
  innocence going from being young kid in awe of the world around him to
  someone who is more battle hardened by the end of it he also said that
  for him important factors in harry psyche are his survivor guilt in
  regard to his dead parents and his lingering loneliness because of
  this radcliffe talked to bereavement counsellor to help him prepare
  for the role radcliffe was quoted as saying that he wished for harry
  to die in the books but he clarified that he can imagine any other way
  they can be concluded after reading the last book where harry potter
  and his friends survive and have children radcliffe stated to be glad
  about the ending and lauded author rowling for the conclusion of the
  story radcliffe stated that the most often repeated question he has
  been asked is how harry potter has influenced his own life to which he
  regularly answers it has been fine and that he did not feel
  pigeonholed by the role but rather sees it as huge privilege to
  portray the character of harry potter according to author rowling
  harry potter is strongly guided by his own conscience and has keen
  feeling of what is right and what is wrong having very limited access
  to truly caring adults rowling said harry is forced to make his own
  decisions from early age on he does make mistakes she conceded but in
  the end he does what his conscience tells him to do according to
  rowling one of harry pivotal scenes came in the fourth book when he
  protects his dead schoolmate cedric diggory body from arch villain
  lord voldemort because it shows he is brave and unselfish rowling also
  said that harry two worst character flaws are anger and occasional
  arrogance but that harry is also innately honourable he not cruel boy
  he competitive and he fighter he doesn just lie down and take abuse
  but he does have native integrity which makes him hero to me he normal
  boy but with those qualities most of us really admire after the
  seventh book rowling commented that harry has the ultimate character
  strength being able to do what even voldemort can not he is not afraid
  of death rowling has also maintained that harry is suitable real life
  role model for children the advantage of fictional hero or heroine is
  that you can know them better than you can know living hero many of
  whom you would never meet if people like harry and identify with him
  am pleased because think he is very likeable outward appearance
  rowling also gave harry potter an uncanny outward appearance
  throughout the entire series harry sports his father perpetually
  untidy black hair his mother green eyes and lightning bolt shaped scar
  on his forehead because of his encounter with lord voldemort and round
  thick eyeglasses she explained that this image simply came to her when
  she first thought up harry potter seeing him as scrawny black haired
  bespectacled boy in the books harry scar serves as an indicator of
  voldemort presence it burns when the dark lord is near or feeling
  particularly murderous or exultant according to rowling by attacking
  harry when he was baby voldemort gave him tools that no other wizard
  possessed the scar and the ability it conferred provided magical
  window into voldemort mind asked why harry forehead scar is lightning
  bolt shaped rowling said to be honest because it cool shape and joked
  couldn have my hero sport doughnut shaped scar abilities and interests
  in the books harry is categorised as half blood wizard in the series
  because although both his parents were magical his mother lily evans
  was muggle born according to rowling to characters for whom wizarding
  blood purity matters lily would be considered as loathsome as muggle
  and derogatively referred to as mudblood throughout the series rowling
  wrote harry potter as gifted wizard apprentice she stated in interview
  with south west news service that harry potter is particularly
  talented in defence against the dark arts and also good in quidditch
  rowling said in the same interview that until about halfway through
  the third book his good friend hermione granger written as the
  smartest student in harry year would have beaten harry in magical duel
  from the fourth book onwards rowling admits harry has become quite
  talented in the defence against the dark arts and would beat his
  friend hermione in magical duel his power is evident from the
  beginning of the series specifically harry shows immediate command of
  broomstick produces patronus at an early age and survives several
  confrontations with voldemort harry is able to speak and understand
  parseltongue language associated with dark magic which according to
  rowling is because he harbours piece of lord voldemort soul after
  voldemort destroys that soul piece in the seventh book climax harry
  loses the ability to speak parseltongue harry is very glad to have
  lost this gift according to rowling harry favourite book is quidditch
  through the ages an actual book that rowling wrote under the pseudonym
  kennilworthy whisp for the comic relief charity possessions when harry
  parents were murdered by lord voldemort they left behind large pile of
  wizard gold used as currency in the world of magic in vault in the
  wizarding bank gringotts this becomes harry source of paying for all
  of his hogwarts textbooks wizarding clothing and spending money as is
  the case with most wizards in the harry potter series his wand is
  among his most valued magical items harry is made of holly wood
  rowling chose because it is said to get rid of evil it forms
  deliberate contrast to the wand of his nemesis lord voldemort whose
  wand is made of yew which symbolises death rowling states she later
  learned that in the celtic calendar type of wood is assigned to each
  month and harry fictional birthday july is linked to holly ron weasley
  and hermione granger also happened to get wands made from the
  appropriate woods identified the celtic calendar according to their
  fictional birth months another valued and useful possession is harry
  cloak of invisibility in his first year at hogwarts school of
  witchcraft and wizardry he gets it anonymously as christmas gift he
  later learns it was given by albus dumbledore who had it in turn from
  harry father harry also owns half of pair of two way mirrors given by
  his godfather sirius black as means of maintaining covert
  communications in book harry potter and the deathly hallows when harry
  and several friends are captured at malfoy manor which lord voldemort
  was using as his headquarters harry uses the mirror to communicate
  with aberforth dumbledore who sends rescue in the form of dobby the
  house elf after sirius death all of his remaining possessions were
  passed along to harry this included the black family residence located
  at number twelve grimmauld place and all the contents and furnishings
  of the house including kreacher the old black family house elf harry
  also inherited the remainder of sirius wealth in wizard gold at
  gringotts another notable possession of harry is magical knife given
  to him by sirius black the knife has the power to open most mechanical
  locks and magical seals the knife was destroyed when harry attempted
  to use it on lock in the department of mysteries when instead of
  opening the desired lock an enchantment destroyed the knife blade by
  the end of deathly hallows harry possesses all three deathly hallows
  the cloak of invisibility the resurrection stone and the elder wand
  they are three of the most powerful magical items in all of the
  wizarding world however harry lost the resurrection stone inside the
  forbidden forest and decides to leave it there harry also takes the
  elder wand and lays it with dumbledore body so the power of the wand
  might be extinguished if he dies natural death however the new
  portrait of dumbledore in the headmaster office agrees that harry
  should keep the invisibility cloak for himself since it was his father
  throughout most of the books harry also has pet owl named hedwig used
  to deliver and get messages and packages when hedwig is killed in the
  seventh book the author said she expected the strong emotional
  reaction of her readers the loss of hedwig represented loss of
  innocence and security she has been almost like cuddly toy to harry at
  times know that death upset lot of people family in the novels harry
  is the only child of james and lily potter but orphaned as an infant
  rowling made harry an orphan from the early drafts of her first book
  she felt an orphan would be the most interesting character to write
  about however after her mother death rowling wrote harry as child
  longing to see his dead parents again incorporating her own anguish
  into him harry aunt and uncle kept the truth about their deaths from
  harry telling him they died in car accident through his marriage to
  draco malfoy harry links the peverell and the house of black families
  it is unknown whether there have been other links between the two
  families history but this is possible as they are among the most
  prominent wizarding families in popular culture harry and the potters
  perform at the horace mann school in riverdale bronx new york note the
  artists black hair and spectacles in harry potter was voted no among
  the best fictional characters by book magazine and also voted the th
  worst briton in channel worst britons we love to hate program in
  addition harry potter is spoofed in the barry trotter series by
  american writer michael gerber where barry trotter appears as the
  eponymous anti hero on his homepage gerber describes trotter as an
  unpleasant character who drinks too much eats like pig sleeps until
  noon and owes everybody money the author stated since really liked
  rowling books felt obligated to try to write spoof worthy of the
  originals in real life harry iconoclastic appearance has become cult
  according to halloweenonline com harry potter sets were the fifth best
  selling halloween costume of in addition wizard rock bands like harry
  and the potters and others regularly dress up in the style of harry
  potter sporting painted forehead scars black wigs and round bottle top

  dumbledore about this and receives stone that might help him fight
  pubertis upon confrontation with pubertis he rubs the stone two times
  which summons ghosts to punch it when it comes to the third time the
  stone starts chafing dumbledore appears and tells harry that the stone
  can only be warmed up three times four if you take week off and that
  pubertis cannot be destroyed since it lives in everyone in epic movie

  drosophila melanogaster is small common fly found near rotting fruit
  it has been in use for over century to study genetics and lends itself
  well to behavioral studies history thomas hunt morgan studied
  drosophila early in the he and his team were the first to discover sex
  linkage and genetic recombination which placed the small fly in the
  forefront of genetic research due to its small size ease of culture
  and short generation time geneticists have been using drosophila ever
  since it is one of the organisms whose entire genome is known and many
  hundreds of genes have been identified and studied life fruit flies
  are easily obtained from the wild and most biological science
  companies carry variety of different mutations in addition these
  companies sell equipment to culture the flies costs are relatively low
  and most equipment can be used year after year behaviour vision the
  fly vision is its most important sense organ approximately two thirds
  of the drosophila brain is dedicated to visual processing although
  their ability to distinguish fine detail is worse than that of humans
  their ability to time things such as flight is about ten times better
  the compound eye of the fruit fly contains units or ommatidia and are
  one of the most advanced among insects each ommatidium contains eight
  photoreceptor cells support cells pigment cells and cornea lens wild
  type flies have reddish pigment cells which serve to absorb excess
  blue light so the fly is not blinded by ambient light flight the wings
  of fly are capable of beating at up to times per second flies fly via
  straight sequences of movement interspersed by rapid turns called
  saccades during these turns fly is able to rotate degrees in fewer
  than milliseconds it was long thought that the characteristics of
  drosophila flight were dominated by the viscosity of the air rather
  than the inertia of the fly body however research has shown that flies
  perform banked turns where the fly accelerates slows down while
  turning and accelerates again at the end of the turn this indicates
  that inertia is the dominant force as is the case with larger flying
  animals reproduction mating fruit flies note the sex combs on the
  forelegs of the male insert in order to mate with female fruit fly the
  male fruit fly has to do special courting dance first he faces the
  female then he follows the female around taps her on the leg vibrates
  wing positions himself behind the abdomen of the female licks her
  genitalia finally the male fruit fly attempts copulation by curling
  his abdomen under hers the female can however kick the male away from
  it with her legs the sexual intercourse usually lasts from about
  minutes in which several hundred relatively long sperm are released
  into the female body the female then stores these sperm in her
  spermathecae and then becomes pregnant it only takes the female few
  days to give birth to about five eggs some reports have the wing
  vibration earlier in the procedure in any event there are some
  differences between even closely related species references

  parts of speech are types of word in grammar there are many different
  word categories they are called lexical categories the most common are
  these part of speech function example words example sentence notes
  verb identifies an action or state to be have do like work sing can
  must london is big city like london noun identifies person place or
  thing pen dog work music town london teacher john new york city is
  very beautiful adjective describes noun an the two some good big red
  well interesting the cat is black and white an the some many are known
  as determiners adverb describes verb adjective or adverb quickly
  silently well badly very really the giraffe eats slowly but when he is
  very hungry he eats really quickly slowly describes the verb eat very
  describes the adjective hungry and really describes the adverb quickly
  pronoun replaces noun you he she some it she is very good at playing
  the piano preposition links noun to another word to at after on but
  the dog is under the table the man ran over the bridge under links the
  noun dog to the noun table over links the verb ran to the noun bridge
  conjunction joins clauses sentences or words and but when or like
  apples and oranges but don like grapes interjection short exclamation
  oh ouch hi well ouch that really hurt verbs nouns adjectives adverbs
  and interjections are called open classes because they are parts of
  speech that can easily add new words on the other hand pronouns
  prepositions and conjunctions are closed classes because new words
  cannot be added easily for example since pronouns are closed class
  there are fairly few pronouns me my mine myself you you your yours
  yourself he him his his himself she her her hers herself it it its its
  itself we us our ours ourselves they them their theirs themselves
  since pronouns are used to replace whole noun phrases there is no need
  to have many kinds of pronouns instead of saying the earl of sandwich
  introduced the earl of sandwich favorite food the sandwich one uses
  the pronoun his to replace the earl of sandwich to make the sentence
  not repeat itself when it doesn have to thus the sentence becomes the
  earl of sandwich introduced his favorite food the sandwich new nouns
  on the other hand can easily be made and are constantly being added

  was so strong that he decided to go to the castle for more when edmund
  returns to the normal world he refuses having been in narnia not
  wanting to admit that lucy was speaking the truth when the four of the
  pevensie children later go through the wardrobe he says that he has
  been in narnia before he and the other siblings are protected by mr
  and mrs beaver but when the beavers and the other three pevensie
  children are having conversation about the arrival of aslan edmund
  sneaks away to the white witch castle where he hopes to be made prince
  and later on king however his thoughts of the witch changes when she
  berates him for coming without his siblings and even more so when on
  their journey to the stone table they find small group of creatures
  enjoying feast made by father christmas when the creatures continue to
  say that father christmas is their benefactor and has entered narnia
  sign that her power is weakening she turns them to stone edmund now
  finds to his horror that the white witch was evil and would give
  anything to be with his brother and sisters the white witch sledge
  eventually stops as the snow melts another sign of the witch crumbling
  power so they have to continue their journey on foot they stop in
  wooded valley where the witch prepares to kill edmund on account of
  his betraying her she ties edmund to tree and takes out dagger but
  rescue party sent by aslan arrives frees him and brings him to his
  siblings and the rest of aslan troop edmund becomes fully sorry after
  long talk with aslan who afterward commands the pevensies to agree the
  matter of their brother misdeeds forgotten the next day the witch
  claims that edmund life is hers she and aslan work out an agreement
  that aslan will die in edmund place though the other narnians do not
  know this but unknown to her the magical nature of this agreement
  allows aslan to be brought back to life susan and lucy witnessed aslan
  resurrection while aslan and lucy and susan race to free the stone
  prisoners in the witch castle edmund joins peter army in the battle
  where he plays role in breaking the white witch dangerous wand and is
  wounded in the attempt then the witch army outnumbered very quickly
  and she is soon killed by aslan while the leftover of the enemies
  either give themselves up or take to flight however edmund is saved
  from death by the arrival of aslan and of lucy who gives edmund few
  dropse of magic cordial which can quickly heal any sickness eventually
  edmund heals is crowned to the great western wood by aslan as king
  edmund the just co ruler of narnia with queen lucy queen susan and

  children again prince caspian edmund and his siblings return to narnia
  to meet caspian rightful king of narnia against king miraz he
  convinces trumpkin the dwarf that they are the kings and queens from
  the legend by defeating him in sword fighting practice later he helps
  peter and trumpkin defend caspian against nikabrik the black dwarf the
  hag and the were wolf edmund is also there to see peter sword duel
  against king miraz edmund has since become more caring for lucy and is
  the first one to believe her when she sees aslan going on her side
  against the disbelief comments of trumpkin and her other siblings
  edmund is shown in the book more nicer than in the lion the witch and
  the wardrobe in the movie edmund proves to be much more mature than
  peter and caspian both but he stays out of their arguments also in the
  movie he is able to stop the white witch from being brought back from

  narnia again by painting and end up in the ocean they are saved and
  brought on board the dawn treader by king caspia who is on journey to
  find the three lords that disappeared this was edmund and lucy last
  adventure in narnia because aslan told them they were getting too old
  to come back by this point edmund had matured great deal which can be
  seen in the way he deals with eustace cousin and in the fights with
  king caspian also edmund has completely stopped insulting lucy when
  eustace cousin changes his behavior after being changed back from
  dragon edmund mentions his own betrayal and says that eustace was not
  worse than he was with the words you are an ass but was traitor the

  <div class="cell"><em>doc no:</em> 13708</div>
  </div>
  <div class="doctext">
  the mask the animated series is television animated series based on
  the comic book superhero the mask but with most of its inspiration
  from the movie adaptation the show ran for three seasons from to and
  spawned its own short run comic book series adventures of the mask
  overview tina carlyle cameron diaz character in the movie was absent
  but reporter peggy brandt had become the main female character unlike
  in the movie ipkiss was able to use the mask in daytime as well as at
  night much as with the beetlejuice cartoon before it the mask tas took
  many elements from the source movie but dropped characters and changed
  certain other characters peggy inclusion also officially discounts the
  cut scene in the movie where she is killed tina is never even alluded
  to however the events of the movie are alluded to as charlie knew that
  stanley was the mask though did not know stanley kept it and stanley
  was still upset over peggy selling him out to the mob given that
  stanley and peggy were never treated as potential couple there may
  have remained some bad feelings over that though the mask himself
  sometimes tries to woo her gypsy at one point claims that the mask is
  the most powerful artifact in the world when she remarks the most
  powerful artifact in the world and this idiot keeps it with his
  laundry the cartoon despite having realistic setting in the fictional
  town of edge city would often rely more on tex avery style humor and
  on occasion broke any meaningful laws of reality one episode featured
  the goofalotatots parodies of the animaniacs treating them as if they
  were naturally alive another featured the mask becoming personal
  assistant to the president of the us with the job merely handed to him
  the president was caricature of no real president it should also be
  noted that former mask comic writer john arcudi wrote both example
  episodes stark departure from his usual writing police officers were
  portrayed as idiots who could not see even obvious clues also
  continued from the movie was the consistent visiting by the mask of
  the coco bongo fictional glamorous night club frequented by the edge
  city well to do which was most likely based on the copacabana in new
  york city in the episode comedy of eras in which dr chronos
  manipulates time so that the future edge city becomes corrupted
  nineteen eighty four like dictatorial society ruled by the villainess
  features coco bongo which has been destroyed development that
  horrifies and enrages the mask and provides him with the motivation to
  ultimately defeat dr chronos characters stanley ipkiss the mask voiced
  by rob paulsen the main protagonist instead of getting rid of the mask
  as in the movie he kept it and whenever he tries gets rid of the mask
  he gets into trouble and is often forced to use the mask to overcome
  these problems sometimes even relying on the mask to fight
  supernatural enemies even facing satan at one point stanley ipkiss is
  portrayed as push over good guy while the mask unlike his violent
  comic book counter part is more of mischievous superhero who as
  stanley had put it would rather go to water polo night at the coco
  bongo then fight crime the mask is also apparently even aware of the
  surroundings when he is not being worn as during one episode stanley
  attempts to control the mask with the sister mask which seems to work
  at first only for the mask to go back to normal and state the sister
  mask doesn work at all though this may actually be due to the mask and
  stanley sharing knowledge the mask also works when broken when the
  mask was split in two each half still works but only does half the
  transformation finally allowing stanley and the mask to converse to
  date the only thing that truly affects the mask is the common cold
  which throws his powers out of whack and will result in the death of
  both the mask and the wearer due to the different personalities the
  mask and stanley have they often refer to each other as separate
  people such as the mask remarking oh stanley is going to hate me in
  the morning in split personalities it is revealed that the mask always
  wanted to give stanley wedgy milo voiced by frank welker stanley dog
  he is frequent wearer of the mask as well lt mitch kellaway voiced by
  neil ross lieutenant constantly trying to prove ipkiss is the mask
  running gag of the show is that he receives atomic wedgies from the
  mask peggy brandt voiced by heidi shannon stanley reporter friend she
  sold out stanley to mobsters in the movie causing their strained
  relationship though their friendship was repaired when peggy rescues
  him several times later she constantly tries to up her career in the
  tabloids biz usually leaving her in sticky situations she is one of
  the many women that the mask has made advances on doyle voiced by jim
  cummings lieutenant kellaway dimwitted partner he is usually the comic
  relief and is occasionally seen eating donut charlie schumacher voiced
  by mark taylor stanley friend in the movie turned into bank manager he
  usually looks out for himself tries to score women has stanley do his
  work for him etc other characters villains the main villain dr
  pretorius voiced by tim curry was madman who had his own head removed
  from his body and placed on tiny spider like robotic legs which could
  attach to larger android body his plans always revolved around either
  obtaining or controlling the mask pretorius is one of the few
  characters in the series aware of the mask true identity or as part of
  some increasingly insane science experiments which if carried out
  would result in the death of thousands or even the end of mankind he
  mostly pronounces ipkiss last name as ipp kiss pretorius was also
  likely parody of drug dealer mob boss eugene rapaz from the original
  comics both share the same face rapaz wore small rounded lens dark
  glasses and pretorius had round optic implants that looked similar as
  well in the episode sister mask dr pretorius did eventually gain the
  mask and as with tyrell retained his own personality while wearing it
  while the mask is said to release one own inhibitions those who have
  no inhibitions seem to retain full conscious control while wearing the
  mask such as the joker in the dc crossover coming from the comics was
  walter pretorius goon still silent and indestructible but not as
  murderous and cruel walter chased the mask for several episodes but
  when he obtained the wooden mask and it failed to work for him he
  simply dropped it walter remained recurring character throughout the
  series he is strong enough to actually break the mask in two an
  impressive feat as only seconds before the mask withstood being hit by
  cars and run over by steamroller without scratch ben stein reprised
  his role as dr neuman from the movie in one episode the mask falls
  into neuman hands and he becomes super villain dr neuman rampaged
  throughout the city claming everyone suffered from disease he called
  he was determined to kill stanley and even goes as far as to spring
  pretorius from prison to aid him running gag however was that dr
  neuman refused to believe the mask worked even when he had it on third
  villain who made it to the tv series for few times was the mad dr
  amelia chronos who with her ambitions of gaining power and dominance
  through the manipulation of time often caused quite lot of chaos
  through inventions like machine that kept looping time every half hour
  for everyone but herself so that even the mask could never foil her
  plans since by the time he got to her everything would be reset to
  half hour prior gun that reversed fast forwarded time for whoever it
  was aimed at so that the person would keep getting younger and younger
  until he she became nothing or became older and older until he she was
  dead large time portal through which she could summon anything to
  defeat the mask such as prehistoric creatures robots from the future
  etc though none of them worked and an actual time machine through
  which she could travel into the past or future to manipulate events so
  that she would ultimately be victorious in her quest for world
  dominance for villains as for the mask transformation there was often
  dc comics parodies as supermask and super salad man parody of superman
  some marvel references were made too like the mask becoming biclops
  parody of cyclops spiderhyny alias spiderman green surfer alias silver
  surfer and toolverine parody of wolverine and villain that turned into
  dinosaur like sauron notable were skillit parody of mr mxyzptlk and
  peter pan albeit much more malevolent in nature and putty thing parody
  of the batman the animated series version of clayface portrayed as
  dumb teenager rather than an angry jaded actor the mask also had few
  more villainous enemies in his rogues gallery such as gorgonzola the
  cheese witch whose powers include the cheese eye an eye laser that
  turns anything into cheese and the shot cheddar razor sharp cheddar
  cheese arrow that would be fired from gorgonzola palm this character
  was created as it was the winner of contest held by disney adventures
  to create new villain for the series the tempest real name french
  drizzle fired weatherman who was struck by lightning which rebounded
  from satellite dish onto him and he was mutated into freak with the
  ability to control the weather he put edge city into hailstorm and
  flood he resembles robin from batman the animated series and has
  powers similar to that of the men storm the mask was able to stop him
  by opening manhole which sucked him down along with the flood waters
  he created not to be confused with the action man villain with similar
  name origin and powers kablamus voiced by jim cummings real name joe
  blow green haired explosive man who could cause destruction by blowing
  himself up like balloon without dying but returning to normal size he
  has special pouch in his costume where he puts different grenades that
  explode with him channel surfer madman who glides using his surfboard
  and travels by teleporting through televisions he had all of edge city
  watch the tv shows he liked and he was able to trap stanley wearing
  the mask inside the television was once man named raymond neilsen who
  went insane after his favorite tv show pointy peaks parody of twin
  peaks was cancelled due to complaints from viewers he is obviously
  parody of silver surfer dragon lady war machine rip tide the dark star
  trio trio of villains who came out of doyle favorite comic book set
  out to kill lt kellaway after mistaking him as their superhero enemy
  the dragon lady kath soucie can transform into dragon fly and breathe
  fire war machine jim cummings is robot armed with deadly weapons and
  ammunition riptide frank welker is punky villain with the ability to
  transform into water stanley the mask defeated the trio by ripping the
  comic book from whence they came parody of the galaxy trio from the
  hanna barbera shorts war machine appears to be parody of the marvel
  superhero of the same name although he robot instead of man in suit
  while riptide is parody of hydro man skillit voiced by jason marsden
  mischievous imp who hails from the shadowland and can use his own
  living shadow to suck the shadows out of other people turning them old
  fast only the mask is immune to this and allowing him to remain
  forever young though he is powerless without his shadow he is over
  years old but in his own words doesn look day over because of this
  when he is captured he is often forced to do homework he has known
  everyone who has ever possessed the mask such as atilla the hun gengis
  khan and blackbeard the pirate chet bozzack voiced by dan castellaneta
  the high school bully of stanley who accidentally wore half of the
  mask when it was cut into two it is later shown that their mask sides
  have something akin to rivalry stanley and chet along with their half
  mask personalities battle ended only when chet stopped his mask
  personality from killing stanley putty thing fish guy the terrible two
  voiced by cam clarke and jeff bennett real names doc and eddie two
  comic book obsessed teenage boys who wanted to be superheroes driven
  by this desire they went into nuclear power plant in hopes of
  obtaining radioactivity they believed that this state would eventually
  turn them into comic book superheroes when coming on contact with bug
  they succeeded but forgot to bring bug both became ill and were sent
  to hospital on the way the ambulance they were on accidentally
  released them and they crashed into two different stores doc in putty
  shop and eddie in an aquarium this transformed them into putty thing
  and fish guy in the episode the terrible two fish guy envied putty
  thing because he had the great scorcher super powers and he didn
  technically he was harmless fish sidekick even worse despite being
  fish he can swim or breathe underwater in the episode the good the bad
  and fish guy he managed to take the mask from stanley and wear it thus
  transforming him into shark dude much more dangerous villain that was
  much stronger and faster than his previous form likewise after putty
  thing landed in tub of radioactive waste he gained the power to shoot
  explosive laser beams from his mouth putty thing later learns how to
  shapeshift the two are likely parody homage to mike myers titular
  wayne world character while fish guy resembles wayne sidekick garth
  algar played by dana carvey cybermite voiced by jim cummings living
  yet obnoxious computer virus in form of fat termite wearing leather
  jacket who manages to invade and infect milo body in fantashtick
  voyage he grows bigger when ever he eats brain cells and occasionally
  says some pretty bad jokes lonnie the shark voiced by glenn shadix
  mobster who has sharp teeth and hairdo that resembles to shark fin
  along with his sidekick pete charlie adler lonnie has his own biker
  gang that cause chaos within edge city they tried to steal the xaw
  battleship in the green marine and attempted to rob bank in malled
  lonnie once disguised himself as barney the dinosaur style kids tv
  host in baby wild ride vicky prat davida steelmine an illusionist
  criminal and an old schoolmate of stanley were she was his crush
  unknown to him she harbours similar infatuation towards him not enough
  to give up her life of crime though she uses illusions as diversion
  while she robs th eactual places while using an illusion of herself
  during her magic show to throw off suspiscion though she is capable of
  creating fireballs to attack with she commonly escapes through her top
  hat she originally appeared to steal valuables from edge city but met
  her old crush stanley and makes him an offer to leave with her he
  refuses and dons the mask to stop her after several failed attempts to
  woo her the mask stops her with his own magic tricks but she
  ultimately escapes in the end only for the mask to take her top hat
  escape route satan the devil here represented in human form with
  vampire like teeth and demon shadow appeared as villain the first time
  he convinced stanley to sign contract to make him become winner
  without using the mask the contract worked stanley gaining prices
  twice and becoming the bank vice president but the devil then tried to
  take him including as the mask in hell as payment however the mask was
  able to discard the contract by challenging and defeating satan in
  dance competition at the coco bongo other secondary characters baby

  painful sexual act is medical problem where person feels pain in their
  genitals before during or after sexual act doctors call this problem
  dyspareunia it can have physical or emotional causes both men and
  women can have dyspareunia up to one fifth of women one in every five
  may have dyspareunia at some point in their lives symptoms in women
  when woman experiences painful sexual act the pain may distract her
  from feeling pleasure and excitement her vagina will be less
  lubricated wet and will not expand dilate as much as usual when the
  vagina is dry and undilated thrusting of the penis is painful even
  after the original cause of her pain has disappeared woman may feel
  pain simply because she expects pain causes in women in most cases
  painful sexual acts have physical cause at first there are many
  physical problems that can cause or worsen painful sexual act doctor
  may be able to identify the cause by doing careful physical
  examination and medical history some of the most common physical
  causes are infections of the vagina urinary tract cervix or fallopian
  tubes endometriosis scar tissue left by surgery like an episiotomy and
  ovarian cysts and tumors common infections are mycoses infections
  caused by fungus candidiasis chlamydia trichomoniasis urinary tract
  infections coliform bacteria monilial organisms and herpes painful
  sexual act can also be caused by problems with woman anatomy like
  hymenal remnants pieces of the hymen that stay in the vagina or female
  genital mutilation or when the entrance to the vagina has become too
  small for normal penetration sarrell and sarrell in women who are past
  menopause common cause of painful sexual act is having too little
  estrogen in women who are breastfeeding common cause is dryness of the
  vagina women who are getting radiation therapy for cancer in the
  pelvic area may have pain during sex because the walls of the vagina
  have atrophied wasted away and are more sensitive to injury dryness in
  the vagina can also be cause of painful sexual act for women with
  sjögren syndrome which attacks the glands that create saliva and tears
  painful sexual act may be one of the first symptoms of cystitis
  bladder infection people with cystitis may have bladder pain during or
  after sex women with cystitis usually have pain the day after sex
  because the muscles around her bladder are spasming tightening up
  painfully women with cystitis usually also have urinary frequency
  needing to urinate lot and or urinary urgency needing to urinate
  suddenly in men there are number of physical factors as well pain is
  sometimes experienced in the testicular or glans area of the penis
  immediately after ejaculation infections of the prostate bladder or
  seminal vesicles can lead to burning or itching sensations following
  ejaculation men suffering from cystitis may experience intense pain at
  the moment of ejaculation and is focused at the tip of the penis
  gonorrheal infections are associated with burning or sharp penis pains
  during ejaculation urethritis or prostatitis can make genital
  stimulation painful or uncomfortable anatomic deformities of the penis
  retraction of too tight foreskin may also result in pain during sexual
  act in men pain in the genital organs during ejaculation or
  immediately thereafter is experienced as sharp stabbing and or burning
  it may be persistent and returning the duration of pain is usually
  brief the immediate cause of psychogenic post ejaculatory pain is the
  involuntary painful spasm or cramping of certain pain sensitive
  muscles in the male genital and reproductive organs the painful muscle
  cramps may be attributable to man conflict about ejaculating pelvic
  floor disorder can also be the cause of pain during and after sex
  diagnosis sufferers will see several doctors before correct diagnosis
  is made sufferers are also often hesitant to seek treatment for
  chronic vulvar pain especially since many women begin experiencing
  symptoms around the same time they become sexually active before being
  successfully diagnosed patients sometimes are told that the pain is in
  their head for the diagnosis doctor carefully takes history and
  carefully examines the pelvis to duplicate the discomfort and to
  identify site or source of the pelvic pain the diagnosis of painful
  sexual act has to be differentiated from conditions known as chronic
  vulvar pain and vaginismus it is worth to be sure whether the painful
  sexual act is acquired or lifelong and whether it is generalized
  complete or situational during the first two weeks painful sexual act
  caused by penis insertion or movement of the penis in the vagina or by
  deep penetration is often due to disease or injury deep within the
  pelvis inquiry should determine whether the pain is superficial or
  deep whether it occurs primarily at the vaginal outlet or vaginal
  barrel or upon deep thrusting against the cervix the possible role of
  psychological factors in either causing or maintaining the pain must
  be acknowledged atrophy of vagina as source of painful sexual act is
  most frequently seen in women after menopause and is generally
  associated with estrogen deficiency the latter is associated with
  inadequacy of lubrication of vagina which can lead to painful friction
  during sexual act treatment doctor explains to the patient what has
  happened including identifies the sites and causes of pain he makes
  clear that the pain will in almost all cases disappear over the time
  or at least will be greatly reduced if there is partner doctor
  explains him also the causes and treatment and encourages him to be
  supportive doctor removes the source of pain when needed he encourages
  the patient to learn about her body to explore her own anatomy and
  learn how she likes to be caressed and touched doctor encourages the
  couple to add pleasant sexually exciting experiences to their regular
  interactions such as bathing together in which the primary goal is not
  cleanliness mutual caressing without sexual act and using sexual books
  pictures and videos in couples where woman is preparing to receive
  vagina act such activities tend to increase both lubrication of vagina
  and its dilation both of which decrease friction and pain prior to
  sexual act oral sex may also prove very useful to relax and lubricate
  the vagina providing both partners are comfortable with it doctor
  prescribes very large amounts of water soluble lubricant during sexual
  act he discourages petroleum jelly moisturizing skin lotion may be
  recommended as an alternative lubricant unless the patient is using
  condom or other latex product lubricant should be liberally applied
  two tablespoons full to both the penis and the orifice of the vagina
  folded bath towel under the receiving partner hips helps prevent
  spillage on bedclothes doctor instructs the receiving partner to take
  the penis of the penetrating partner in their hand and control
  insertion themselves rather than letting the penetrating partner do it
  for those who have pain on deep penetration because of pelvic injury
  or disease doctor recommends change in sex positions to one admitting
  less penetration in women receiving vaginal penetration maximum
  vaginal penetration is achieved when the receiving woman lies on her
  back with her pelvis rolled up off the bed compressing her thighs
  tightly against her chest with her calves over the penetrating partner
  shoulders minimal penetration occurs when receiving woman lies on her
  back with her legs extended flat on the bed and close together while
  her partner legs straddle hers manual physical therapy treating pelvis
  and vagina sticking togethers may decrease or eliminate pain during
  sexual act related conditions vaginismus endometriosis dyspareunia

  house the letter is from princess peach she asks mario and luigi to
  come to party of hers so mario and luigi set out the party is set in
  princess peach castle while luigi stays in the lobby mario goes
  upstairs to find peach peach asks mario to come with her so they can
  chat in peace but as soon as they begin to walk the castle begins to
  crumble the player can see that the castle is actually raising into
  space but peach and mario are confused especially since they can see
  stars outside in the middle of the day then all of sudden king bowser
  smashes through the window riding his koopa clown car he has his
  companion kammy koopa with him as soon as bowser tells peach and mario
  that he was the one who lifted the castle into space using the star
  rod with the purpose of kidnapping peach mario begins to fight him
  despite the failures of the past however this time just as bowser says
  is different because bowser has the star rod in the middle of the
  fight he transforms himself into rainbow bowser making him stronger
  and invincible of course there is no way mario can defeat bowser now
  so bowser simply destroys mario after his job is done he throws mario
  out into space followed by koopatrols taking peach to her room
  meanwhile mario falls miles towards the earth

  married to woman and fathered three children susanna hamnet and judith
  people have debated his sexuality some people such as peter holland of
  the shakespeare institute at birmingham university have argued that
  shakespeare was possibly bisexual because of some of the sonnets he
  wrote that were directed towards young men who wrote shakespeare about
  years after shakespeare died some writers began to say that the work
  called shakespeare were not really written by william shakespeare they
  had various reasons for saying this for example the person who wrote
  shakespeare knew lot about other countries especially italy and france
  but william shakespeare never left england several other writers of
  shakespeare have been suggested such as francis bacon christopher
  marlowe and edward de vere th earl of oxford most scholars believe

  clickable image use cursor to identify poly edward de vere th earl of
  oxford poly francis bacon rect william shakespeare poly christopher
  marlowe poly william stanley th earl of derby some people say that
  some of the works attributed to william shakespeare of stratford upon
  avon were not actually written by him the scientific argument behind
  this claim is known as the shakespeare authorship question anti
  stratfordians say shakespeare of stratford was false name to shield
  the identity of the real author or authors these authors did not want
  their real names to become public for various resons although the idea
  has attracted much public interest all but few shakespeare scholars
  and literary historians consider it fringe belief and for the most
  part acknowledge it only to rebut or disparage the claims shakespeare
  authorship was first questioned in the middle of the th century at
  that time the idea that shakespeare was the greatest writer of all
  time had become widespread shakespeare had simple background and some
  details of his life are unknown these facts seemed to be incompatible
  with his poetic eminence and his reputation for genius some people
  suspected that shakespeare might not have written the works attributed
  to him the controversy has since spawned vast body of literature and
  authorship candidates have been proposed including francis bacon the
  th earl of derby christopher marlowe and the th earl of oxford some
  anti stratfordians say william shakespeare lacked the education
  aristocratic sensibility or familiarity with the royal court they also
  say that these characteristics can be found in his works those
  shakespeare scholars who have responded to such claims hold that
  biographical interpretations of literature are unreliable in
  attributing authorship and that the convergence of documentary
  evidence used to support shakespeare authorship title pages testimony
  by other contemporary poets and historians and official records is the
  same used for all other authorial attributions of his era no such
  direct evidence exists for any other candidate and shakespeare
  authorship was not questioned during his lifetime or for centuries
  after his death despite the scholarly consensus relatively small but
  highly visible and diverse assortment of supporters including
  prominent public figures have questioned the conventional attribution
  they work for acknowledgment of the authorship question as legitimate
  field of scholarly inquiry and for acceptance of one or another of the
  various authorship candidates references

  rupert idea to steal the untouched shoes of morgan and use them as
  exchanging goods was able to get lot of items while morgan did not
  plan as well twist for this season sent one player from the tribe
  winning reward to steal one item from the other tribe camp morgan lost
  most of the early reward and immunity challenges leaving them three
  players down and with less items to work with at camp during this time
  osten member of morgan started to say that he wanted to quit the game
  with drake looking like they were going to continue to win burton
  started plan to purposely lose the fourth immunity challenge to get
  rid of the tribe weaker players such as trish and christa though
  rupert and others thought this was bad idea they did it anyway
  purposely allowing morgan to win in twist jeff probst said that morgan
  won the right to kidnap one drake member through the next reward
  challenge and morgan quickly chose rupert as result burton was voted
  out at drake first tribal council the change in power lead to morgan
  winning the next two immunity challenges and leaving the tribes equal
  five members on each tribe when they arrived at their next challenge
  the tribes found out that there was another twist as the six players
  they had voted off before returned to the game as an outcast tribe in
  the next challenge the outcasts tribe won against morgan and drake
  both would have to vote off player at separate tribal councils while
  the outcasts tribe would vote in two players to return to the game in
  their place osten quit the game at morgan tribal council host jeff
  probst wasn happy when osten quit the outcasts tribe chose lil and
  burton to return to the game both by chance returning to their
  starting tribes but having immunity at the next tribal council while
  burton made up with his old tribe lil return didn make the other
  morgan members too happy the next day the two tribes merged combined
  into one tribe which the players named balboa name given to sea snake
  that rupert had found and tried to nurse back to health but failed the
  tribe moved to drake beach burton and rupert won individual immunities
  and along with lil anger helped to voted out old morgan members andrew
  and ryan now there were more old drake members than old morgan members
  jon and burton started to see rupert as physical threat for challenges
  and wanted to vote him off bothering rupert alliance members sandra
  and christa in the next reward challenge where family and loved ones
  of the players were brought to the islands jon had planned weeks
  before with his best friend to play the story of dead grandmother
  hoping to use it to gain sympathy though sandra knew he was lying jon
  successfully convinced the other players making them to give up the
  reward to jon and then having to spend one night on morgan old beach
  while jon and his friend hung out alone celebrating the lie success
  jon and burton planned to vote off the rest of the women players
  voting off tijuana and christine with five players left burton won car
  reward and took jon with him away from camp this allowed sandra lil
  and darrah to make plan to vote off burton by having sandra act like
  she was certainly the next one to go burton and jon knew the woman
  were probably working against them and to his surprise burton was
  voted off at the following tribal council leaving jon struggling to
  try to win back the women trust the next immunity challenge had yet
  another twist as though it was trivia quiz the jury played also the
  jury won so none of the players left had immunity darrah was voted off
  leaving jon lil and sandra as the final three during the last immunity
  challenge sandra fell out early so jon to try to convince lil to take
  him to the final two lil said no and won the immunity challenge lil
  struggled with her decision of who to take to the last tribal council
  but chose sandra during the last tribal council they jury said that
  lil behavior during the game was not what people expected of
  scoutmaster and they asked questions lil could not easily answer
  sandra was voted the sole survivor on vote of in the reunion show she
  found out that if she had taken jon to the final two she likely would
  have won players player starting tribe merged tribe finish total votes

  <div class="doctext">
  the apostrophe is punctuation mark used in writing it is diacritic
  mark used with letters in english it has two jobs to show where one or
  more letters have aabeen left out as in the abbreviation contraction
  of do not to don to show the possessive case as in the cat whiskers
  examples its versus it the most common grammatical mistake in written
  english is to put it where its is correct its possessive adjective and
  pronoun of the personal pronoun it the cat chased its tail correct the
  tyre lost it grip wrong it contraction of the verbal phrase it is or
  it has it mine correct check it is mine it been here correct check it
  has been here the cat chased it tail wrong cannot be expanded to it is
  the same applies to yours theirs and ours because these are also
  possessive adjectives of personal pronouns the colour is ours that
  book is hers or his theirs was the responsibility possession
  apostropes are also used to show something belongs to someone or
  something again correct uses can be expanded mike car correct the car
  that belongs to mike the dog ball correct the ball that belongs to the
  dog those dog are large wrong cannot be expanded here dogs is plural
  word the intrusive apostrophe comes in plurals which don do not need
  it do not put an apostrophe in word ending in such as plural put an
  apostrophe or at the end of the word instead mrs jones hat or mrs
  jones hat both correct both of my parents birthdays correto cd and dvd
  technically right but considered by many as wrong see plural section
  apple and pear wrong writing dialogue or titles apostrophes are also
  used when other words are shortened as in slang go get em tiger or li
  bow bow this is just version of the abbreviation function plural to
  make word that doesn does not usually exist as plural into plural an
  apostrophe is occasionally used it is important to note that this is
  considered by many incorrect for example how many did you get this
  year the poll received many yes and very few no references

  exatly years after its first release that release featured sneak peek
  of direct to video sequel called dumbo ii the preview showed lot of
  sketches and storyboard ideas the main story has to do with dumbo and

  wonder into the big city dumbo new friends are claude and lolly the
  twin bears who leave chaos everywhere they go dot the curious zebra
  godfrey the hippo who is older and wants to do things for himself and
  penny the adventurous ostrich timothy returns as well the story was
  supposed to be as if the first dumbo ended and this one started the
  next day the project seems to have been canceled as no further
  announcements have been made since plus the fact that the little
  mermaid ariel beginning tinker bell and its sequels were to be the
  last projests for disneytoon studios the crow characters in the movie
  are seen as african american stereotypes the leader crow was
  originally named jim crow for script purposes and the name stuck the
  other crows are all voiced by african american actors all members of
  the hall johnson choir despite suggestions of racism by some many
  historians such as zoe pritchard reject these claims for instance the
  crows are noted as forming the majority of the characters in the movie
  who are sympathetic to dumbo plight the others are timothy mouse and
  mrs jumbo are free spirits who serve nobody and intelligent characters
  aware of the power of self confidence unlike the stepin fetchit
  stereotype common at that time furthermore their song when see an

  for the play by shakespeare see julius caesar play gaius julius caesar
  july bc march bc was military commander politician and author at the
  end of the roman republic caesar became member of the first
  triumvirate and when that broke up he fought civil war against pompey
  the great winning the war caesar became dictator for life of the roman
  republic he was assassinated by his enemies in rome early life julius
  caesar was born in italy around july bc the exact date is not known he
  was born gaius julius caesarius troubled youth at sixteen he was the
  head of his family and soon came under threat as lucius cornelius
  sulla became dictator sulla set about purging rome of his enemies
  hundreds were killed or exiled and caesar was on the list his mother
  family pleaded for his life sulla reluctantly gave in but stripped
  caesar of his inheritance from then on lack of money was one of the
  main problems in his life caesar joined the army and left rome he only
  returned after sulla death in bc on the way across the aegean sea
  caesar was kidnapped by pirates and held prisoner he maintained an
  attitude of superiority throughout his captivity when the pirates
  thought to demand ransom of twenty talents of silver he insisted they
  ask for fifty after the ransom was paid caesar raised fleet pursued
  and captured the pirates and imprisoned them he had them crucified on
  his own authority as he had promised while in captivity promise the
  pirates had taken as joke as sign of leniency he first had their
  throats cut he was soon called back into military action on the way up
  on his return to rome he was elected military tribune first step in
  political career he was elected quaestor for bc his wife cornelia died
  that year after her funeral caesar went to serve his quaestorship in
  spain on his return in bc he married pompeia granddaughter of sulla
  whom he later divorced in bc he ran for election to the post of
  pontifex maximus high priest of the roman state religion he ran
  against two powerful senators there were accusations of bribery by all
  sides caesar won comfortably despite his opponents greater experience
  and standing after his praetorship caesar was appointed to govern
  roman spain but he was still in considerable debt and needed to
  satisfy his creditors he turned to marcus licinius crassus one of rome
  richest men in return for political support crassus paid some of
  caesar debts and acted as guarantor for others caesar left for his
  province before his praetorship had ended in spain he conquered two
  local tribes was hailed as imperator by his troops and completed his
  governorship in high esteem though he was due triumph in rome he also
  wanted to stand for consul the most senior magistracy in the republic
  faced with the choice between triumph and the consulship caesar chose
  the consulship after election he was consul in bc the first
  triumvirate caesar took power with gnaeus pompeius magnus pompey the
  great and marcus licinius crassus these three men ruled rome and were
  called the triumvirate caesar was the go between for crassus and
  pompey they had been at odds for years but caesar tried to reconcile
  them between the three of them they had enough money and political
  influence to control public business this informal alliance known as
  the first triumvirate rule of three men was cemented by the marriage
  of pompey to caesar daughter julia caesar also married again this time
  to calpurnia who was the daughter of another powerful senator caesar
  proposed law for the redistribution of public lands to the poor
  proposal supported by pompey by force of arms if need be and by
  crassus making the triumvirate public pompey filled the city with
  soldiers and the triumvirate opponents were intimidated caesar gallic
  war with the agreement of his partners caesar became the governor of
  gallia gaul gaul is the area which is today northern italy switzerland
  and france caesar was the commander of the roman legions during the
  gallic war the war was fought on the side of rome gallic clients
  against the germans who wanted to invade gaul it was also to extend
  rome control of gaul caesar conquest of gaul extended rome territory
  to the north sea in bc he conducted the first roman invasion of
  britain caesar wrote about this eight year war in his book de bello
  gallico about the gallic wars this book written in latin is an
  important historical account these achievements got him great military
  power and threatened to eclipse pompey the balance of power was
  further upset by the death of crassus in bc caesar civil war in bc the
  senate led by pompey ordered caesar to disband his army and return to
  rome because his term as governor had finished caesar thought he would
  be prosecuted if he entered rome without the immunity enjoyed by
  magistrate pompey accused caesar of insubordination and treason
  crossing the rubicon caesar and his army approached rome and crossed
  the rubicon shallow river in north east italy in bc it was the point
  beyond which no army was supposed to go the river marked the boundary
  between cisalpine gaul to the north and italy proper to the south
  crossing the rubicon caused civil war pompey the lawful consul and his
  friends fled from rome as caesar army approached pompey managed to
  escape before caesar could capture him caesar decided to head for
  spain while leaving italy under the control of mark antony caesar made
  an astonishing day route march to spain where he defeated pompey
  lieutenants he then returned east to challenge pompey in greece there
  in july bc at dyrrhachium caesar barely avoided catastrophic defeat he
  then decisively defeated pompey at the battle of pharsalus later that
  year dictator at last in rome caesar was appointed dictator with mark
  antony as his master of the horse second in command caesar presided
  over his own election to second consulship and then after eleven days
  resigned this dictatorship late in bc he was appointed dictator again
  with term of one year caesar then pursued pompey to egypt where pompey
  was soon murdered caesar then became involved in an egyptian civil war
  between the child pharaoh and his sister wife and co regent queen
  cleopatra perhaps as result of the pharaoh role in pompey murder
  caesar sided with cleopatra he is reported to have wept at the sight
  of pompey head which was offered to him by the pharaoh as gift in any
  event caesar defeated the pharaoh forces in bc and installed cleopatra
  as ruler caesar and cleopatra celebrated their victory with triumphant
  procession on the nile in the spring of the royal barge was
  accompanied by additional ships introducing caesar to the luxurious
  lifestyle of the egyptian pharaohs caesar and cleopatra never married
  roman law only recognized marriages between two roman citizens caesar
  continued his relationship with cleopatra throughout his last marriage
  which lasted years in roman eyes this did not constitute adultery and
  may have fathered son called caesarion cleopatra visited rome on more
  than one occasion staying in caesar villa outside rome across the
  river tiber in bc caesar defeated cato and the remnants of pompey
  supporters in africa he was then appointed dictator for ten years in
  two years he made numerous changes in roman administration to improve
  the republic many of these changes were meant to improve the lives of
  ordinary people one example which has lasted was his reform of the
  calendar into the present format with leap day every four years in
  february of bc one month before his assassination he was appointed
  dictator for life assassination on the ides of march march of bc
  caesar was due to appear at session of the senate mark antony fearing
  the worst went to head caesar off the plotters expected this and
  arranged for someone to intercept him according to eutropius around
  sixty or more men participated in the assassination he was stabbed
  times according to suetonius physician later established that only one
  wound the second one to his chest had been lethal the dictator last
  words are not known with certainty and are contested subject among
  scholars and historians alike the version best known in the english
  speaking world is the latin phrase et tu brute you too brutus in
  shakespeare julius caesar this is the first half of the line et tu
  brute then fall caesar according to plutarch after the assassination
  brutus stepped forward as if to say something to his fellow senators
  they however fled the building brutus and his companions then marched
  to the capitol while crying out to their beloved city people of rome
  we are once again free they were met with silence as the citizens of
  rome had locked themselves inside their houses as soon as the rumour
  of what had taken place had begun to spread he has been mentioned in
  many many movies wax statue of caesar was erected in the forum
  displaying the stab wounds crowd who had gathered there started fire
  which badly damaged the forum and neighbouring buildings in the
  ensuing chaos mark antony octavian later augustus caesar and others
  fought series of five civil wars which would end in the formation of
  the roman empire the roman empire and its emperors were so important
  in history that the word caesar was used as title in some european
  countries to mean emperor even long after the roman empire was gone
  for example germany emperor was called kaiser up to the year ce and
  russia emperor was called tsar until the year ce caesar as author
  commentarii de bello gallico an account written by julius caesar about
  his nine years of war in gaul caesar was significant author the
  commentarii de bello gallico commentaries on the gallic war campaigns
  in gallia and britannia during his term as proconsul and the
  commentarii de bello civili commentaries on the civil war events of
  the civil war until immediately after pompey death in egypt other
  works historically attributed to caesar but whose authorship is
  doubted are de bello alexandrino on the alexandrine war campaign in
  alexandria de bello africo on the african war campaigns in north
  africa and de bello hispaniensi on the hispanic war campaigns in the
  iberian peninsula these narratives were written and published on
  yearly basis during or just after the actual campaigns as sort of
  dispatches from the front apparently simple and direct in style to the
  point that caesar commentarii are commonly studied by first and second
  year latin students they are in fact highly sophisticated tracts aimed
  particularly at the middle brow readership of minor aristocrats in
  rome italy and the provinces epilepsy based on remarks by plutarch
  caesar is sometimes thought to have suffered from epilepsy modern
  scholarship is divided on the subject it is more certain that he was
  plagued by malaria particularly during the sullan proscriptions of the
  caesar had four documented episodes of what may have been complex
  partial seizures he may additionally have had absence seizures petit
  mal in his youth the earliest accounts of these seizures were made by
  the biographer suetonius who was born after caesar died the claim of
  epilepsy is countered among some medical historians by claim of
  hypoglycemia this can cause seizures which are bit like epilepsy in
  psychiatrist harbour hodder published what he termed as the caesar
  complex theory arguing that caesar was sufferer of temporal lobe
  epilepsy and that the symptoms were factor in caesar decision to forgo
  personal safety in the days leading up to his assassination references
  ref caesar was kidnapped by pirates and held prisoner

  an abortion is when pregnancy ends early without the birth of any live
  children developing human takes about thirty eight weeks to grow and
  be born normally this occurs about forty weeks after the mother last
  menstrual period this developing human is called an embryo for the
  first eight weeks of the pregnancy and fetus for the rest of the
  pregnancy an abortion takes place when the embryo fetus is too young
  and small to survive without its mother when an abortion occurs
  naturally it is often called miscarriage humans can also chose to end
  the pregnancy before birth takes place this is called an induced
  abortion often the term abortion often refers only to an induced
  abortion in both types of abortion the embryo or fetus usually comes
  out of the womb this is called complete abortion in some cases the
  embryo or fetus remains inside the womb this is called missed abortion
  surgery is needed to remove the embryo or fetus from the womb so the
  woman does not get an infection different countries have different
  laws regarding induced abortion while abortion is illegal in many
  countries there are often exceptions that permit it in cases such as
  family incest rape the fetus having severe disabilities or the mother
  health being at risk spontaneous abortions names people speak of
  spontaneous abortion or miscarriage when the embryo or fetus is lost
  due to natural causes before the th week of pregnancy pregnancy that
  ends this way but that is between and weeks old is known as premature
  birth if the baby is born alive if the fetus dies in the womb after
  weeks or while it is born this is known as stillbirth premature births
  and stillbirths are generally not considered to be miscarriages how
  common they are spontaneous abortions miscarriages are common about
  fifteen percent of pregnancies end in spontaneous abortion in many
  cases the woman is not even aware she was pregnant the pregnancy is
  only few days or weeks old and the woman believes the miscarriage is
  just her menses about twenty five percent of all women will have
  spontaneous abortion during their lives most miscarriages occur very
  early between ten and fifty percent of pregnancies end with
  miscarriage where the mother or the doctors are aware of it these
  figures depend on the age and health of the pregnant woman most
  spontaneous abortions occur so early in the pregnancy that the woman
  is not even aware that she was pregnant one particular study showed
  that of pregnancies end in miscarriage before weeks in of these
  miscarriages the woman did not know she was pregnant the risk of
  spontaneous abortion decreases sharply after the th week of pregnancy
  lennart nilsson child is born with loss rate between weeks lmp and
  birth of about two percent pregnancy loss is virtually complete by the
  end of the embryonic period some people are more likely to have
  spontaneous abortion those people who have already had several
  spontaneous or induced abortions run greater risk of having
  spontaneous one those with certain diseases and those over the age
  also run greater risk other causes for abortions can be the infection
  of either the woman or embryo fetus or their immune response certain
  diseases or an accidental trauma can also cause spontaneous abortion
  putting the woman under trauma or stress to cause miscarriage is
  considered induced abortion some countries call this feticide cause of
  spontaneous abortions most miscarriages are due to problems with the
  copying of chromosomes but some are caused by environmental factors
  when human is conceived it gets chromosomes from its mother and from
  its father if it does not get the right number its development happens
  wrong it does not grow right it may have many bad birth defects most
  embryos and fetuses with chromosome problems will not live for long
  time they die very early there are few chromosome problems that babies
  can sometimes be born with for example down syndrome happens when
  there are three copies of chromosome usually people have of every
  chromosome this is called trisomy tri means symptoms of spontaneous
  abortions the most common symptom is bleeding from the vagina this can
  be very little blood less blood than normal menses it can be very much
  blood much more than normal menses some women have bad pains in their
  low abdomen when they have miscarriage this is sometimes like the pain
  of menses it can be much worse or woman may have no pain at all if the
  pregnancy is many weeks old the woman may see the embryo or fetus when
  it comes out but if it is less than weeks old woman may not see
  anything but blood treatment of spontaneous abortions usually no
  treatment is needed for miscarriage however sometimes some pregnancy
  tissue remains in the womb after the miscarriage and must be removed
  sometimes doctors do surgical abortion this is the same kind of
  surgery that is done for induced abortions doctors can also prescribe
  women medicines that can help the miscarriage finish without needing
  surgery induced abortions an induced abortion is when things are done
  to end the pregnancy on purpose these things are normally done by
  doctors in countries where abortion can be done legally it is often
  done by specialists who know lot about women bodies gynecologists
  abortions done illegally are often performed by people without this
  special knowledge this makes them more dangerous such abortions are
  usually called unsafe abortions back alley abortions or diy abortions
  mainly because the risk to the health of the mother is much higher
  than with abortions carried out by skilled doctors reasons for an
  induced abortion there can be medical reasons why an abortion is
  performed these include saving the life of the pregnant woman
  preserving the woman physical or mental health ending pregnancy that
  would result in child being born with severe birth defects which would
  be fatal or which would increase the risk of the child dying at an
  early age reducing the number of fetuses to lower the health risks
  associated with multiple pregnancy like twins kinds of induced
  abortions there are two different kinds of induced abortions the type
  of abortion that is done depends on few different things like what the
  woman wants what her doctor thinks is best and how far along woman is
  in her pregnancy how long she has been pregnant one type of induced
  abortion is called medical abortion or medication abortion in this
  type of abortion doctor gives the woman one or two medications that
  will end her pregnancy medication abortion can only be done early on
  in the pregnancy this is because the medications that are used work
  best when they are started as early as possible and after woman has
  been pregnant for about two months the medications usually do not work
  very well because of this medication abortion usually is not used
  after woman has been pregnant for weeks some of the benefits or
  reasons why some women choose this type of abortion are that it can be
  started as soon as woman realizes she is pregnant it does not require
  anesthesia and the woman does not have to have procedure in hospital
  or clinic to have the fetus removed like with the other kind of
  abortion that is done after woman is given the medication or
  medications that end her pregnancy the abortion happens like
  spontaneous abortion or miscarriage the woman passes the fetus along
  with the blood and tissue that have built up in the uterus from her
  vagina the most common medications that are used for medication
  abortions are mifepristone and misoprostol first doctor gives the
  woman mifepristone which is sometimes also called ru or the abortion
  pill this drug blocks the hormone progesterone in the body without
  progesterone the embryo cannot survive the lining of the uterus
  becomes thinner and the embryo cannot grow or stay attached to the
  lining of the uterus after few days doctor gives the woman misoprostol
  this makes the uterus contract or get smaller and the embryo is
  expelled from or pushed out of the uterus through the woman vagina
  sometimes another medication called methotrexate is used along with
  misoprostol in medication abortions woman is given methotrexate
  usually as shot in doctor office and the drug stops the embryo from
  staying attached to the lining of the uterus then misoprostol is given
  few days later with the second type of abortion called surgical
  abortion or in office abortion doctor does procedure that removes an
  embryo or fetus from the woman uterus this kind of abortion can be
  done in different ways depending on how long the woman has been
  pregnant surgical abortion is simpler and there are fewer problems
  that can happen if it is done earlier on in the pregnancy the most
  common form is called an aspiration abortion or suction curettage this
  can be done in doctor office or clinic first the woman cervix the top
  part of the uterus is dilated or made bigger medical tool is used to
  suction out everything inside the woman uterus including the fetus if
  the woman has been pregnant for more than weeks the doctor first has
  to dilate the cervix or make the cervix bigger usually by putting
  small sticks into the cervix to help it open up if another tool called
  curette has to be used to scrape out tissue that is still inside the
  uterus then this form of abortion is sometimes called dilation and
  curettage or risks and complications pregnancy that ends without child
  being born also may cause some problems to the woman this happens to
  there are two broad groups of things that can happen it affects the
  mental health of the woman it affects the physical heath of the woman
  physical problems abortion is safer than childbirth if it is done
  before the th week of pregnancy and it is done by professional certain
  methods of abortion are pretty safe and complications are rare
  generally stopping pregnancy that has gone on longer is riskier women
  usually feel small amount of pain during first trimester abortion in
  study of patients reported having some amount of pain patients rated
  the pain as being less than earache or toothache but more than
  headache or backache local and general anesthesias are used during the
  abortion psychological problems few studies have been done to see if
  an abortion affects the woman psychologically or mentally those that
  have been done give contradictory results one study looked at women
  who had become pregnant even though they did not want to the study
  found that having an induced abortion does not increase the risk of
  getting mental health problems the group that was compared were women
  who also did not want to have baby but who did not have an abortion
  other studies showed similar results women who had an abortion did
  better in school or at work after the abortion another study showed
  that women who had an abortion had higher self esteem and felt better
  than those who did not many women who had an abortion felt better
  afterwards they also felt relieved they would do it again in similar
  situation study done in new zealand in showed that many women who had
  an abortion developed severe depressions up to years after they had
  the abortion they were also more likely to have problems with alcohol
  and illegal drugs than those women who did not have an abortion the
  person who oversaw the study later told media that given these results
  it would be very hard to say that having an abortion has no
  psychological effects on the woman who has it he called the abortion
  traumatic experience other problems both spontaneous and induced
  abortions have some risk for the woman if bad thing happens because of
  surgery or medicine that doctor gives or because of miscarriage it is
  called complication complications of abortions can be infection
  bleeding pain there may or may not be problems getting pregnant again
  this is still being researched in places where induced abortions are
  legal less than of induced abortions have bad complication if doctors
  do induced abortions the risk to the woman is less than the risk of
  complications of childbirth giving birth to baby in places where
  induced abortions are legal less women have complications of induced
  abortion than in places where induced abortion is illegal this is
  because induced abortions that are not done by doctors have much more
  risks for example after induced abortions became legal in the united
  states in less women died from having abortions in the united states
  in women died from the complications of legal abortion the risk of
  death from legal abortion is of the risk of an appendectomy the risk
  of death from an injection shot of penicillin an antibiotic is bigger
  than the risk of death from legal abortion there can be emotional
  problems for the woman after spontaneous or induced abortion she may
  feel sad angry or guilty that she had miscarriage or asked for an
  abortion she may think she has done something that made the
  miscarriage happen or that having an abortion was the wrong thing to
  do and because of this she may feel intense grief there are many
  places where women can get help dealing with these feelings some women
  who have induced abortions may get criticism from friends or family
  who have different beliefs when scientists look at this in research
  studies however they do not usually see that women have emotional
  problems after induced abortions in president ronald reagan told the
  surgeon general of the us to look at this question both president
  reagan and the surgeon general everett koop did not think abortion was
  right dr koop looked at papers that scientists wrote in scientific
  journals dr koop said that the science we know does not show that
  induced abortions cause emotional problems for women who have them
  numbers and reasons for induced abortions the number of induced
  abortions done are different for different parts of the world this is
  also true for the reasons why women decide to have an abortion
  estimates are that about million induced abortions are done worldwide
  every year million of them occur in places where abortion is legal
  million happen in countries where it is illegal to have an abortion
  some countries like belgium per known pregnancies and the netherlands
  per have low rate of induced abortion others like russia per and
  vietnam per have comparatively high rate overall there are induced
  abortions per known pregnancies the who estimated in that every year
  about million women get pregnant and that there are about mililon live
  births the remaining million cases are miscarriages or induced
  abortions about forty percent of pregnancies are unplanned and about
  fifth of the pregnant women decide to end the pregnancy early this
  results in about million abortions per year about million of these are
  legal the rest are agains the law most of the illegal abortions is
  performed by medically unqualified people often with poor hygiene
  which often threaten the lives of the women the who estimated that
  about women died in because of illegal abortions this number was lower
  than the estimate of mainly because in south america women opted to
  take drugs to end the pregnancy methods used for abortions times when
  abortions are done histogram of abortions by gestational age in
  england and wales during average is weeks abortion rates vary the
  length the pregnancy has gone on and the method used to do the
  abortion influence these rates according to data collected in the
  united states of abortions were done in the first twelve weeks of
  pregnancy between week and week of the pregnancy the remaining were
  done in week or later were done by curettage were medical abortions
  using drugs mifepristone in most cases by intrauterine instillation
  saline or prostaglandin and by other including hysterotomy and
  hysterectomy the guttmacher institute estimated there were intact
  dilation and extraction procedures in the during of the total number
  of abortions performed that year similarly in england and wales in of
  terminations occurred at or under weeks between and weeks and at or
  over weeks of those reported were by vacuum aspiration by and were
  medical later abortions are more common in china india and other
  developing countries than in developed countries personal and social
  factors for abortions bar chart from study done in in shows the
  reasons why women had an abortion in study was done in countries this
  study wanted to find the reasons why women wanted to end their
  pregnancy it found that women often gave one of the following reasons
  worries about their work or their education not sure about how to pay
  for the child they were going to have worries about the stability of
  the relationship with their partner feeling that they were not yet
  mature enough to have child different study done in the united states
  in came to similar conclusions women who had an abortion in finland
  and the united states usually did not state that the pregnancy posed
  risk to their health in bangladesh india and kenya however more such
  women thought the pregnancy was risk to their health of women in the
  survey based study became pregnant as result of rape and as result of
  incest another american study in concluded that of women who had an
  abortion were using form of contraception at the time of becoming
  pregnant inconsistent use was reported by of those using condoms and
  of those using the combined oral contraceptive pill of those using
  condoms reported failure through slipping or breakage the guttmacher
  institute estimated that most abortions in the united states are
  obtained by minority women because minority women have much higher
  rates of unintended pregnancy some women have an abortion because the
  society they live in pressures them to in certain parts of the world
  disabled people have problems to fit into society the sex of the child
  might influence the status of the mother often mothers who bear boys
  have higher social status than those who bear girls in many parts of
  the world raising child is very difficult task for single unmarried
  mother certain countries like china have measures to control their
  population growth any of these factors might force pregnant woman to
  have an abortion abortion and the law dark blue legal red illegal
  other colors are for illegal with some exceptions rape threat of life
  to the mother induced abortion is not legal in every place in some
  countries doctor who does an induced abortion is committing crime in
  the united states canada and many countries in europe abortion is
  legal not crime in some countries like ireland and somalia it is legal
  only to save the life of the woman if woman is raped in ireland and
  becomes pregnant she cannot get an induced abortion in some countries
  like chile and el salvador abortion is never legal including in cases
  where the woman risks dying from continuing the pregnancy in countries
  where induced abortion is not legal many more women die from abortion
  women still get induced abortions but they cannot get them in safe
  hospitals and clinics these induced abortions have more complications
  than abortions done by doctors women who live in places where abortion
  is illegal or heavily frowned upon sometimes travel to other places
  where an abortion can be done legally so they can have an abortion
  this is form of medical tourism spontaneous abortion in other mammals
  spontaneous abortions occur in various mammals in sheep it may be
  caused by crowding through doors or by being chased by dogs in cows
  abortion may be caused by contagious diseases such as brucellosis or
  campylobacter this can often be controlled by vaccination though
  abortion may also be induced in animals in the context of animal
  husbandry for example abortion may be induced in mares that have been
  mated improperly or that have been purchased by owners who did not
  realize the mares were pregnant or that are pregnant with twin foals
  feticide can occur in horses and zebras usually this is done because
  males harass pregnant mares or force copulation scientists have raised
  the question how often this occurs in the wild though male gray langur
  monkeys may attack females following male takeover causing miscarriage
  opinions about induced abortions induced abortion is subject that is
  controversial each person has system of moral values based on their
  system of morals people have different opinions about it religion can
  also influence this opinion different opinions around the world number
  of opinion polls have been carried out around the world they have
  tried to find out what people think about abortion results were
  different for different countries but also varied with the questions
  that were asked in may survey was done in ten european countries the
  people were asked if they could agree with the statement if woman does
  not want children she should be allowed to have an abortion the
  highest level of approval was in the czech republic the lowest was in
  poland poll was done in november the poll asked people in canada in
  what circumstances they believed an abortion should be permitted
  responded that they believe abortion should be legal in all
  circumstances that it should be legal in certain circumstances and
  that it should never be legal similar poll in april surveyed people in
  the united states about abortion said that abortion should be legal in
  all cases said that abortion should be legal in most cases said
  abortion should be illegal in most cases and said abortion should be
  illegal in all cases in gallup poll taken in july of however of
  americans identified themselves as pro life and the same percentage of
  americans identified themselves as pro choice november poll in mexico
  found that think abortion should not be legalized while think it
  should of attitudes in south america december survey found that of
  argentines thought that abortion should be allowed in argentina
  regardless of situation that it should be allowed under some
  circumstances and that it should not be allowed regardless of
  situation march poll about abortion in brazil found that of brazilians
  believe that it should not be modified that it should be expanded to
  allow abortion in other cases that abortion should be decriminalized
  and were not sure july poll in colombia found that said they thought
  that abortion should remain illegal that it should be made legal and
  that they were unsure pro life and pro choice some people feel very
  strongly about abortion people who think think the law should let
  women choose to have abortions are called pro choice people who think
  that abortion is wrong and that the law should not allow it are called
  pro life people who are pro choice believe that women should be
  allowed to have control over their own bodies when it comes to ending
  or continuing pregnancy they believe that because the embryo or fetus
  is inside the woman body and does not have developed enough organs to
  survive on its own until later in the pregnancy it is not yet person
  with rights pro choice people also make the argument that abortion
  needs to be legal in order to protect women because when abortion is
  illegal it does not completely stop abortions from happening but makes
  it so that women try to do abortions on themselves or get them done by
  people who are not trained doctors which puts those women in danger of
  death or injury pro choice people believe the way to prevent abortion
  is to make sure women only get pregnant when they want to in addition
  to advocating the legality of abortion pro choice groups like planned
  parenthood often try to improve people access to things used to
  prevent pregnancy called contraception and try to teach young people
  about sex to reduce the number of teen pregnancies people who are pro
  life believe that all humans including the unborn have right to life
  for this reason they believe abortion is wrong and that it is murder
  they think the law should make abortion crime in order to protect
  innocent life within the womb however though pro life people think
  abortion is wrong there are special cases in which some pro life
  people will sometimes support allowing an abortion to happen like if
  the pregnancy puts the woman life at risk or if she got pregnant from
  rape pro life people think women who are pregnant and do not want to
  raise child should look for alternatives to abortion such as giving
  the baby up for adoption there are many crisis pregnancy centers pro
  lifers have started to help women in these situations they have also
  started advocacy groups like the american life league feminists for
  life and live action to try to convince more people to think abortion
  is wrong and to try to get governments to make laws to restrict
  abortion sometimes people who are against abortion have used violence
  to try to stop abortions from happening like bombing the clinics that
  do abortions or shooting the people who work inside them however most
  people who are against abortion do not do such things and believe that
  they are wrong and so they try to stop abortions from happening
  through peaceful activism religious views many religions have view on
  abortion these views span broad spectrum from acceptance to rejection
  most religions generally oppose abortion selected issues of the debate
  generally when there is debate about whether abortion laws should be
  changed in country there are advocacy groups some of the arguments
  these groups often have are outlined below breast cancer hypothesis
  there is hypothesis that induced abortion raises the risk of getting
  breast cancer people who support this call it link rather than
  hypothesis the subject has been controversial but currently scientists
  agree that there is no link between abortion in the first trimester
  and increasing the risk to get breast cancer in early pregnancy levels
  of estrogen increase this causes the breast to grow and to prepare for
  lactation in the studies were done on rats before this hypothesis was
  put forward can the embryo or fetus feel pain it is currently unclear
  from what moment the embryo or fetus can feel pain this is also used
  in the debate about abortion many researchers think that fetus is
  unlikely to feel pain until after the seventh month of pregnancy
  others disagree at about twenty six weeks of pregnancy certain
  connections are made in the thalamus of the growing fetus
  developmental neurobiologists suspect that these connections may be
  critical to perception of pain by the fetus however legislation has
  been proposed by pro life advocates requiring abortion providers to
  tell woman that the embryo or fetus may feel pain during an abortion
  procedure researchers from the university of california san francisco
  published study in the journal of the american medical association the
  study analyzed data from dozens of medical reports and other studies
  the researchers concluded that fetuses are unlikely to feel pain until
  the third trimester of pregnancy however number of medical critics
  have since disputed these conclusions there are certain connections in
  the thalamus of the fetuse these connections develop at about twenty
  six weeks of pregnancy at the end of the th century there was an
  emerging consensus among developmental neurobiologists that these
  connections are very important when it comes to the perception of pain
  in the fetus other researchers such as anand and fisk have challenged
  this late date positing that pain can be felt around twenty weeks pain
  can have many different aspects it might be purely relying on sensory
  input but it might also involve emotions and thought for this reason
  it is perhaps impossible to know exactly when the embryo or fetus
  feels pain even if it has developed the links in the thalamus

  miscarriage is the natural death of an embryo or fetus in the womb
  before it is old enough to live on its own outside the mother the
  medical words for miscarriage are spontaneous abortion spontaneous
  means something that person did not expect to happen an abortion is
  when pregnancy ends early before birth among women who know they are
  pregnant about have miscarriages this means that up to in every women
  who know they are pregnant miscarries it is the most common
  complication serious problem that happens in early pregnancy in humans
  miscarriage vs stillbirth in the united states if fetus dies after it
  is weeks old its death is no longer called miscarriage its death is
  called stillbirth fetal demise or fetal death demise means death but
  different countries have different ways of defining the difference
  between miscarriage and fetal death for example in this country
  miscarriage is fetal death is norway death of fetus under weeks old
  death of fetus over weeks old australia death of fetus under weeks old
  death of fetus over weeks old united kingdom death of fetus under
  weeks old death of fetus over weeks old italy death of fetus under
  weeks old death of fetus over weeks old spain death of fetus under
  weeks old death of fetus over weeks old causes of miscarriage nobody
  knows all of the reasons why woman may miscarry however some common
  causes include genetic problems like aneuploidy problems with the
  mother uterus or hormones an infection somewhere in the mother
  reproductive system tissue rejection where the mother body reacts to
  the fetus like it is something that does not belong in her body
  serious physical trauma injury like bad car accident very rarely
  medical procedures that are used to diagnose problems with the fetus
  can cause miscarriage this happens in only about of cases out of when
  woman has had chorionic villus sampling cvs or amniocentesis the most
  common causes of miscarriage change depending on what trimester the
  mother is in each trimester lasts about three months first trimester
  weeks this is what human embryo looks like about eight weeks after
  conception most miscarriages happen during the first trimester some
  studies say that two thirds two out of three to three quarters three
  out of four of all miscarriages happen during this trimester about to
  to in every of all fertilized eggs miscarry often before woman knows
  she is pregnant in more than half of embryos miscarried in the first
  weeks of pregnancy the embryo has chromosomes that are not normal
  these chromosomal problems may happen because of problems as the
  embryo grows and its cells make copies of themselves it is also
  possible for chromosomal problems to happen because of problem with
  parent genes however this is more likely to happen in women who has
  had other miscarriages or if one of the parents has child or other
  relatives with birth defects genetic problems are more likely to
  happen with older parents this may be why miscarriages are more common
  in older women another cause may be the mother not having enough
  progesterone if woman is diagnosed with low progesterone levels in the
  second half of her menstrual cycle the luteal phase she may be
  prescribed progesterone to take during the first trimester of her
  pregnancy however when woman might already be miscarrying there is no
  evidence that first trimester progesterone pills decrease the risk of
  having miscarriage scientists have even questioned whether problems
  with the luteal phase really can cause miscarriages second trimester
  weeks common causes of miscarriage during the second trimester are
  uterine malformation when the mother uterus is not shaped normally
  growths in the mother uterus these are called fibroids problems with
  the mother cervix these problems can also cause premature birth when
  baby is born earlier than expected one study found that of second
  trimester miscarriages were caused by problems with the umbilical cord
  the fetus gets blood and oxygen through the umbilical cord every part
  of the body needs blood and oxygen to survive if the baby cannot get
  enough oxygen because of problem with the cord it can die problems
  with the placenta may also cause second trimester miscarriages
  nutrients and blood pass through the placenta in order to get from the
  mother to the umbilical cord the placenta also helps filter out some
  things that could hurt the fetus if there is problem with the placenta
  the fetus could die because it did not get enough nutrients and oxygen
  or because the placenta did not filter out harmful things how is
  miscarriage diagnosed miscarriage is usually diagnosed when pregnant
  woman notices that she is having certain symptoms and goes to see
  doctor the most common symptom of coming miscarriage is bleeding
  during early pregnancy the woman may not have any pain usually if
  pregnant woman is bleeding or having pain an ultrasound should be done
  the ultrasound can show that the fetus heart is not beating which
  means that the fetus has miscarried if this happens special tests
  should be done to make sure the woman does not have an ectopic
  pregnancy which can kill woman not all light bleeding during early
  pregnancy means woman is having miscarriage but any woman having light
  bleeding during pregnancy should see her doctor if the bleeding is
  heavy the woman is having lot of pain or she has fever she should go
  to an emergency room or call an ambulance to take her to the hospital
  if woman has bleeding during her pregnancy she may be diagnosed with
  threatened miscarriage in the past if doctor thought pregnancy might
  miscarry in the future they would suggest bed rest for the mother
  lying in bed for most of the time today most doctors and scientists
  think that bed rest does not help how is miscarriage treated there are
  few different types of miscarriage in complete miscarriage the fetus
  has totally left the mother body so has the placenta there are no
  pieces of fetal or placental tissue left in the uterus in missed
  miscarriage the fetus has miscarried but is still inside the mother
  body this often happens when the mother does not realize she had
  miscarriage which is common when the pregnancy is very early on in an
  incomplete miscarriage parts of the fetus or the placenta are still in
  the uterus the treatment is different for each kind of miscarriage
  complete miscarriage if woman has complete miscarriage she usually
  does not need any medical treatment incomplete or missed miscarriage
  if woman has an incomplete miscarriage or missed miscarriage there are
  three different choices for treatment watchful waiting means that
  doctor will keep checking on the woman but will not give any treatment
  unless problem happens with watchful waiting most of these
  miscarriages will pass naturally in two to six weeks this means that
  the tissue left in the woman will leave her body through the vagina
  without any treatment with no treatment watchful waiting most of these
  cases will pass naturally within two to six weeks this path avoids the
  side effects and complications possible from medications and surgery
  but increases the risk of mild bleeding need for unplanned surgical
  treatment and incomplete miscarriage medical management means that
  medicine is given usually medicine called misoprostol is given
  misoprostol makes the uterus contract get tighter to push out whatever
  is inside in about of cases out of the fetal or placental tissue that
  is left in the uterus will leave the woman body within few days
  surgery is the fastest way to complete miscarriage it also makes
  bleeding less heavy and makes it not last as long also the woman will
  not have to go through the physical pain of the miscarriage most often
  one of two surgeries is used to complete the miscarriage vacuum
  aspiration sometimes called dilation and evacuation in tube attached
  to pump sucks the tissue left in the uterus out through the cervix
  dilation and curettage in the cervix is widened and the tissue left in
  the uterus is scraped and scooped out curettage compared to giving
  medications has higher risk of causing problems for example the cervix
  or uterus may be injured because of this some women prefer not to have
  because they want to have children in the future and want to lower the
  chances of problems during future pregnancies however if woman has had
  more than one miscarriage is the most convenient way to get tissue
  samples which can be studied to see if reason for the miscarriages can
  be found which treatment should be used the choice of which treatment
  to use depends on many things including what the mother wants however
  there are guidelines that doctors use to suggest what treatment to use
  missed miscarriage the most important things that help doctors decide
  what to do are the age and size of the embryo and the size of the
  gestational sac the fluid around the embryo for embryos that were less
  than weeks old and the smallest gestational sacs watchful waiting is
  the best choice because the embryo will often leave the mother body
  naturally for embryos that were weeks old with larger sizes and
  gestational sacs medicine is suggested but either watchful waiting or
  surgery might be used depending on the situation for the embryos that
  were over weeks old with the largest gestational sacs surgery is
  suggested because the mother is likely to have lot of pain and
  bleeding when she miscarries incomplete miscarriages for an incomplete
  miscarriage the size of the tissue left in the uterus is the most
  important thing that helps doctors decide what to do ultrasound is
  used to find out how large the tissue is if the tissue left is smaller
  than mm millimeters watchful waiting is usually the best choice
  because it is likely that the tissue will leave the mother body on its
  own if the tissue is between and mm medical or expectant management
  are suggested surgery is chosen only if there is specific reason why
  the mother needs it if the tissue is over to mm these things are
  suggested giving misoprostol to make the tissue left in the uterus
  leave the mother body on its own more quickly having the mother stay
  in the hospital to be watched for few hours or overnight she should
  stay until most of the tissue left in her uterus has passed and she
  has stopped bleeding if misoprostol has not worked surgery may be
  needed risk factors risk factor for miscarriage is something that
  makes woman more likely to miscarry there are many risk factors for
  miscarriage for example the age of the mother women older than age
  have higher risk of miscarriage than younger women at age woman has
  about percent risk at age the risk is about percent and at age it
  about percent multiple pregnancies pregnancies with more than one
  fetus like twins and triplets the more fetuses in the womb the higher
  the risk if the mother has certain diseases like diabetes especially
  the mother needs insulin and her diabetes is still not controlled well
  hypothyroidism especially when the hypothyroidism is very bad some
  infections like hiv rubella malaria and some sexually transmitted
  diseases like chlamydia gonorrhea and syphilis if the mother or father
  smokes tobacco cigarettes if the mother drinks alcohol while she is
  pregnant especially if she drinks often or drinks lot at once the
  united kingdom national health service says that drinking alcohol
  becomes risk factor if mother drinks more than one glass of wine more
  than one shot of whiskey or more than two thirds of pint of beer week
  most doctors say that no amount of alcohol during pregnancy is safe if
  the mother uses illegal drugs like cocaine while she is pregnant if
  the mother is injured exposed to certain poisons or is using an iud
  when she gets pregnant problems with the mother uterus or cervix some
  types of food poisoning more things to read congenital disabilities
  that can cause miscarriage ultrasound used to diagnose miscarriage
  dilation and curettage dilation and evacuation stillbirth references

  uncle tom fullpage illustration by hammatt billings for uncle tom
  cabin first edition boston john jewett and company cassy helps tom
  after he is beaten by simon legree uncle tom the title character of
  the story is patient noble unselfish black slave stowe wanted him to
  be noble hero in the book he stands up for what he believes in even
  though they do not want to even his enemies admire him recently
  however his name has also been used negatively people often think of
  uncle tom as an old black man trying to make his masters happy as
  people have criticized his quiet acceptance of slavery however others
  argue that this is not true first of all uncle tom is not really old
  he is only eight years older than mr shelby which shows that he is
  probably around fifty also tom is not happy with slavery his
  acceptance is not because of stupidity or because he likes slavery it
  is because of his religious faith which tells him to love everyone
  wherever uncle tom goes he loves and spreads comfort and kindness he
  helps slaves escape such as eliza emmeline and cassy he also refuses
  to beat other slaves because of this he is beaten himself stowe was
  not trying to make tom an example for blacks but for white and black
  people she says that if white people were to be loving and unselfish
  like uncle tom slavery would be impossible eliza harris eliza harris
  is mrs shelby favorite maid george harris wife and harry mother eliza
  is brave intelligent and very beautiful young slave eliza loves her
  son harry very much it is possible her love for him was even greater
  because she lost two of her first infant children her motherly love is
  shown when she bravely escapes with her son perhaps the most well
  known part of uncle tom cabin is the part where eliza escapes on the
  ohio river with harry this escape is said to have been inspired by
  story heard in the lane theological seminary in cincinnati by john
  rankin to stowe husband calvin professor at the school in rankin story
  in february young slave woman had escaped across the frozen ohio river
  to the town of ripley ohio with her child in her arms and stayed at
  his house before she had gone further towards the north eva picture of
  tom and eva by hammatt billings for the edition of uncle tom cabin eva
  evangeline st clare is st clare and marie angelic daughter she enters
  the story when tom saves her from drowning when he was going to be
  sold eva asks her father to buy tom she says want to make him happy
  through her tom becomes st clare leading coachman and eva especial
  attendant helper tom had orders to let everything else go and attend
  to miss eva whenever she wanted him orders which our readers may fancy
  imagine were far from disagreeable to him she is very beautiful her
  form was the perfection of childish beauty her face was remarkable
  less for its perfect beauty of features than for singular strange and
  dreamy earnestness seriousness of expression all marked her out made
  her different from the other children and made every one turn and look
  after her to tom she seemed something almost divine and whenever her
  golden head and deep blue eyes peered looked out upon him he half
  believed that he saw one of the angels stepped out of his new
  testament he says that she got the lord mark in her forehead eva is an
  almost perfect christ like child she is very sad about slavery she
  does not see the difference between blacks and whites she talks very
  much about love and forgiveness even topsy is touched by her love eva
  becomes one of the most important people in tom life ophelia st clare
  ophelia st clare is perhaps the most complicated female character in
  the novel st clare calls her desperately good it tires me to death to
  think of it she does not like slavery however she does not like to be
  touched or come close to any black person as human being when she
  first saw eva shaking hands and kissing with the blacks she declared
  that it had fairly turned her stomach made her feel sick she adds want
  to be kind to everybody and wouldn have anything hurt but as to
  kissing how can she she has clear strong active mind and is very
  practical however she has warm heart which she shows in her love for
  st clare and eva ophelia hates slavery but has deep prejudice against
  blacks st clare as challenge to her buys topsy he tells her to try
  educating her at first she tries to teach and help topsy simply
  because of duty however stowe says that duty is not enough there must
  be love eva death changes ophelia when topsy cries she said she loved
  me there an is not nobody left now ophelia gently says as honest tears
  fell down her face topsy you poor child can love you though am not
  like that dear little child hope ve learnt something of the love of
  christ from her can love you and ll try to help you to grow up good
  christian girl stowe thought that there were many people like miss
  ophelia st clare who did not like slavery but could not think of
  blacks as people she wanted to write about such problems through miss
  ophelia other characters arthur shelby the owner of uncle tom in
  kentucky shelby sells tom to mr haley to pay his debts arthur shelby
  is clever kind and basically good hearted man however he still does
  slavery and is not as morally strong as his wife stowe used him to
  show that slavery makes everyone who does it become wicked not just
  the cruel masters emily shelby is arthur shelby loving gentle and
  christian wife she thinks slavery is wrong she tries to persuade her
  husband to help the shelby slaves and is one of the many kind female
  characters in the story george shelby is the young son of mr and mrs

  stronger than his father he does what he promises and thinks george
  harris eliza husband very clever and curious mulatto man he loves his
  family very much and fights for his freedom bravely and proudly
  augustine st clare eva father augustine st clare is romantic playful
  man he does not believe in god and drinks wine every night he loves
  eva very deeply and feels sorry for his slaves however like mr shelby
  he does not do anything about slavery marie the wife of st clare she
  is yellow faded sickly woman whose time was divided among variety of

  the opposite of people like mrs shelby and mrs bird she thinks slavery
  is good and says about topsy if had my way now send her out and have
  her thoroughly whipped have her whipped till she couldn stand after
  her husband dies she sells all the slaves topsy the heathenish black
  slave girl who miss ophelia tries to change at first miss ophelia
  approaches her new subject very much as person might be supposed to
  approach black spider supposing them to have benevolent kind designs
  toward it topsy feels this difference from duty and love when eva says
  miss ophelia would love you if you were good she laughs and says no
  she can bar bear me cause nigger black she soon have toad touch her

  think nobody never made me in the early to mid some doll companies
  made dolls that looked like topsy the expression growed like topsy
  later grew like topsy began to be used in the english language at
  first it meant to describe growing without planning it later it simply
  meant growing lot simon legree slave owner who cannot break uncle tom
  of his christian faith he has uncle tom whipped to death because of
  this he sexually exploits his female slaves cassy and emmeline his
  name is used as synonym for cruel and greedy man important themes the
  picture shows george harris eliza harry and mrs smyth after they
  escape to freedom by hammatt billings for uncle tom cabin first
  edition slavery uncle tom cabin most important theme is the evil of
  slavery every part in uncle tom cabin develops the characters and the
  story but most importantly it always tries to show the reader that
  slavery is evil un christian and should not be allowed one way stowe
  showed the evil of slavery was how it forced families from each other
  motherhood stowe thought mothers were the model for all of american
  life she also believed that only women could save the united states
  from slavery because of this another very important theme of uncle tom
  cabin is the moral power and sanctity of women white women like mrs
  bird st clare mother legree mother and mrs shelby try to make their
  husbands help their slaves eva who is the ideal christian says that
  blacks and whites are the same black women like eliza are brave and
  pious she escapes from slavery to save her son and by the end of the
  novel has made her whole family come together again some critics said
  that stowe female characters are often unrealistic however stowe novel
  made many people remember the importance of women influence and helped
  the women rights movement later christianity stowe puritanical
  religious beliefs are also one of the biggest themes in the novel she
  explores what christianity is like she believed that the most
  important thing in christianity was love for everyone she also
  believed that christian theology shows that slavery is wrong this
  theme can be seen when tom urges st clare to look away to jesus after
  st clare daughter eva dies after tom dies george shelby says what
  thing it is to be christian because christian themes are so important
  and because stowe often directly spoke in the novel about religion and
  faith the novel is written in the form of sermon style eliza crossing
  the icy river in an theater poster uncle tom cabin is written in
  sentimental and melodramatic style this style was often used in the th
  century sentimental novel and domestic fiction also called women
  fiction these genres were the most popular novels of stowe time it
  usually had female characters and style that made readers feel
  sympathy and emotion for them stowe novel is different from other
  sentimental novels because she writes about large theme like slavery
  it is also different because she has man uncle tom as the main
  character however she still tried to make her readers have strong
  feelings when they read uncle tom cabin like making them cry when eva
  died this kind of writing made readers react powerfully for instance
  georgiana may friend of stowe wrote letter to the writer in the letter
  she said that was up awake last night long after one clock reading and
  finishing uncle tom cabin could not leave it any more than could have
  left dying child another reader said that she thought about the book
  all the time and even thought about changing her daughter name to eva
  the death of eva affected lots of people in baby girls in boston were
  named eva even though many readers were very moved literary critics
  did not like the style in uncle tom cabin and other sentimental novels
  they said these books were written by women and had women sloppy messy
  emotions one literary critic said that if the novel not been about
  slavery it would be just another sentimental novel another said the
  book was piece of hack messy work in the literary history of the
  united states george whicher called uncle tom cabin sunday school
  fiction however in jane tompkins wrote differently about uncle tom
  cabin in her book in sensational designs the cultural work of american
  fiction tompkins praised uncle tom cabin style she said that
  sentimental novels showed how women emotions changed the world in good
  way she also said that the popular domestic novels written in the th
  century like uncle tom cabin were intelligently written she also said
  that uncle tom cabin shows critique of american society far more
  devastating powerful than any by better known critics such as
  hawthorne and melville reactions to the novel uncle tom cabin has had
  very great influence there are not many novels in history that changed
  society so powerfully when it was published uncle tom cabin people who
  defended slavery were very angry and protested against it some people
  even wrote books against it abolitionists praised it very much as best
  seller the novel greatly influenced later protest literature
  contemporary and world reaction as soon as it was published uncle tom
  cabin made people in the american south very angry the novel was also
  greatly criticized by people who supported slavery famous novelist
  from the south william gilmore simms said that the book was not true
  others called the novel criminal and said it was full of lies person
  who sold books in mobile alabama had to leave town for selling the
  novel stowe received threatening letters she even received package
  with slave cut ear once many southern writers like simms soon began
  writing their own books about slavery some critics said that stowe had
  never actually went to southern plantation and she did not know much
  about southern life they said that because of this she made wrong
  descriptions about the south however stowe always said she made the
  characters of her book by stories she was told by slaves that ran away
  to cincinnati ohio where she lived it is reported she observed
  firsthand herself several incidents happenings which inspired her to
  write the famous anti slavery novel scenes she observed saw on the
  ohio river including seeing husband and wife being sold apart as well
  as newspaper and magazine accounts and interviews contributed material
  to the plot in stowe published key to uncle tom cabin this was to show
  the people who had criticized the novel description of slavery that it
  was true in the book stowe writes about the important characters in
  uncle tom cabin and about people in real life who were like them
  through this book she writes more aggressive attack on slavery in the
  south than the novel itself had like the novel key to uncle tom cabin
  was also best seller however many of the works in key to uncle tom
  cabin was read by stowe after she published her novel even though
  there were such criticisms the novel was still very popular stowe son
  says that when abraham lincoln met her in lincoln said so this is the
  little lady who started this great war historians are not sure if
  lincoln really said this or not in letter that stowe wrote to her
  husband few hours after meeting with lincoln she does not say anything
  about this sentence after this many writers have said that this novel
  helped make the north angry at slavery and at the fugitive slave law
  it greatly helped the abolitionist movement union general and
  politician james baird weaver said that the book made him help in the
  abolitionist movement uncle tom cabin also interested many people in
  england the first london edition came out in may it sold copies some
  of this interest was because at that time the british people did not
  like the united states writer said the evil passions which uncle tom
  gratified in england were not hatred or vengeance of slavery but
  national jealousy and national vanity we have long been smarting
  hurting under the conceit of america we are tired of hearing her boast
  that she is the freest and the most enlightened country that the world
  has ever seen our clergy hate her voluntary system our tories hate her
  democrats our whigs hate her all parties hailed mrs stowe as revolter
  from the enemy charles francis adams the american minister to britain
  during the war said later that uncle tom cabin or life among the lowly
  published in influenced the world more quickly powerfully and
  dramatically than any other book ever printed uncle tom cabin was
  published in russia at the end of and was soon recognized as classic
  of world literature many people saw very strong link between the world
  of uncle tom cabin and the serfdom that still existed in russia in in
  his letter to an abolitionist maria weston chapman nikolay turgenev
  wrote many of the scenes described in the book seem like an exact
  depiction of equally frightful scenes in russia uncle tom cabin served
  as an educational tool for russian and russo soviet elite in the post
  emancipation period and it also became part of soviet children
  literature the book has been translated into almost every language for
  example it was translated into chinese its translator lin shu made
  this the first chinese translation of an american novel it was also
  translated into amharic its translation was made to help ethiopia end
  the suffering of blacks in that nation the book was read by so many
  people that sigmund freud believed that some of his patients had been
  influenced by reading about the whipping of slaves in uncle tom cabin
  literary importance and criticism uncle tom cabin was the first widely
  read political novel in the united states it greatly influenced
  american literature and protest literature some later books that were
  greatly influenced by uncle tom cabin are the jungle by upton sinclair
  and silent spring by rachel carson however even though uncle tom cabin
  was very important many people thought the book was mix of children
  fable and propaganda many critics called the book merely only
  sentimental novel george whicher wrote in his literary history of the
  united states that nothing attributable to mrs stowe or her handiwork
  can account for the novel enormous great vogue popularity its author
  resources of sunday school fiction were not remarkable melodrama humor
  and pathos compounded made up her book other critics though have
  praised the novel edmund wilson said that to expose oneself in
  maturity when one has grown up to uncle tom cabin may prove startling
  surprising experience jane tompkins said that the novel is one of the
  classics of american literature she suggested that literary critics
  think badly of the book because it was simply too popular when it came
  out through the years people have wondered what stowe was trying to
  say with the novel some of her themes can be seen easily like the evil
  of slavery however some themes are harder to see for example stowe was
  christian and active abolitionist and put lots of her religious
  beliefs in her book some have said that stowe wrote in her novel what
  she thought was solution to the problem that worried many people who
  did not like slavery this problem was was doing things that were not
  allowed justified if they did it to fight evil was it right to use
  violence to stop the violence of slavery was breaking laws that helped
  slavery right which of stowe characters should be followed the patient
  uncle tom or the defiant george harris stowe thought that god will
  would be followed if each every person sincerely truly examined his
  principles and acted on followed them people have also thought uncle
  tom cabin expressed the ideas of the free will movement in this idea
  the character of george harris symbolizes the free labor the complex
  character of ophelia shows the northerners who allowed slavery even
  though they did not like it dinah is very different from ophelia she
  acts by passion in the book ophelia changes like ophelia the
  republican party three years later declared that the north must change
  itself it said that the north must stop slavery actively feminist
  theory can also be seen in stowe book the novel can be seen as
  criticizing slavery patriarchal nature for stowe families were related
  by blood not by family like relations between masters and slaves stowe
  also saw the nation as bigger family so the feelings of nationality
  came from sharing the same race because of this she supported the idea
  that freed slaves should live together in colony the book has also
  been seen as trying to show that masculinity was important in stopping
  slavery abolitionists began to change the way they thought of violent
  men they wanted men to help stop slavery without hurting their self
  image or their position in society because of this some abolitionists
  followed some of the principles of women suffrage peace and
  christianity they praised men for helping working together and having
  mercy other abolitionists were more traditional they wanted men to act
  more forcefully all the men in stowe book show either patient men or
  traditional men creation and popularization of stereotypes
  illustration of sam from the new edition of uncle tom cabin the
  character of sam helped make the stereotype of the lazy carefree happy
  darky recently some people have begun criticizing the book for what
  they thought were racist descriptions of the book black characters
  they criticized the way stowe wrote about the characters looks speech
  behavior and the passive nature of uncle tom the book use of common
  stereotypes about african americans is important because uncle tom
  cabin was the best selling novel in the world in the th century
  because of this the book together with images in the book and related
